Overview

Develop a streamlined web-based platform that allows users to upload images into galleries without requiring authentication. The platform should focus on simplicity, ease of use, and immediate sharing capabilities. A drag-and-drop interface on the homepage enables users to upload images, which are automatically organized and accessible via a unique, shareable link.

Core Features

User Flow

Homepage as Drop Zone:

The homepage is a large, interactive drag-and-drop area where users can drop images.

Images begin uploading automatically upon being dropped, with an upload progress indicator.

Automatic Gallery Creation:

Once images are uploaded, the page refreshes to a new, unique URL representing the gallery.

This unique link is public and can be shared immediately with others.

Image Display:

Uploaded images are displayed in a visually appealing masonry-style grid layout.

The grid dynamically adapts to the number of images and screen size for responsiveness.

No Authentication:

No sign-up, login, or authentication is required for users to create or access galleries.

Public Sharing:

All galleries are accessible via unique public links.

Galleries do not require passwords or additional permissions for viewing.

Technical Requirements

Frontend

Homepage:

Use React.js for a responsive and interactive frontend.

Implement a large drop zone using a library like react-dropzone.

Show real-time progress bars during image uploads.

Gallery Page:

Display images in a masonry grid using libraries like react-masonry-css.

Ensure the page dynamically adapts to uploaded images and is mobile-friendly.

Backend

Server:

Use Node.js with Express for API and gallery management.

Generate a unique ID or slug for each gallery (e.g., UUID or random string).

Automatically associate uploaded images with the newly created gallery.

Storage:

Store uploaded images in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or Firebase Storage.

Optimize images for fast loading (e.g., resize and compress on upload).

Database:

Use a lightweight database like SQLite or PostgreSQL to store gallery metadata (e.g., gallery ID, creation timestamp, image links).

Real-time Functionality

Instant Gallery Creation:

Once all images are uploaded, redirect the user to the new gallery link automatically.

Use WebSockets or similar technology for real-time updates during uploads.
