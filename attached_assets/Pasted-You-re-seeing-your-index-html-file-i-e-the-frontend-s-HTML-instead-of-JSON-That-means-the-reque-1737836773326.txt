You’re seeing your index.html file (i.e., the frontend’s HTML) instead of JSON. That means the request to "/api/notifications" is not going through your backend route; it’s being served by the frontend dev server (Vite, etc.), which returns the app’s index.html for unknown or client-side routes.

Hence, the browser receives HTML when it expects JSON, causing the “string did not match the expected pattern” or “Unexpected token <” error.

Why It’s Happening
When using a frontend dev server (like Vite) and a separate Node/Express server:

The frontend dev server typically handles all requests on its domain. If you request "/api/..." from the same domain (without a proxy), Vite doesn’t know about your real Node endpoint and falls back to serving index.html.

To call your Node/Express route, you must either:

Make sure you’re calling the correct domain/port where the Node server is actually running, or
Set up a proxy in the Vite configuration so that requests to "/api" are forwarded to the Node server.
How to Fix It
Option A: Use the Full Backend URL
If your Node server is running at something like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://your-node-app.username.repl.co
then in your React code, do:

ts
Copy
Edit
const res = await fetch(
  "https://your-node-app.username.repl.co/api/notifications",
  {
    // credentials: "include", // if needed
  }
);
const data = await res.json();
That ensures the request actually goes to your Node server, not the Vite dev server.

Option B: Set Up a Dev Proxy in Vite
If you want to keep using a relative path like "/api/notifications", you can configure Vite’s dev server to proxy those requests to your Node server. In vite.config.js (or vite.config.ts):

js
Copy
Edit
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'https://your-node-app.username.repl.co',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '/api'),
      },
    },
  },
});
Now when your React code calls fetch("/api/notifications"), Vite will forward that to https://your-node-app.username.repl.co/api/notifications. That should return JSON from your Node route rather than HTML.

Option C: Serve the Frontend from the Same Express App
You can also combine your frontend and backend into a single Express server that serves both static files and API routes. Then "/api/notifications" will be handled by your Express route, and the rest of the paths serve React’s index.html.
