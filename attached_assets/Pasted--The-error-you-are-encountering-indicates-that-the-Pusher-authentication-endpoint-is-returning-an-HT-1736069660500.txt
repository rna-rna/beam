The error you are encountering indicates that the Pusher authentication endpoint is returning an HTML document (likely your app's frontend page) instead of the expected JSON payload. This is causing the subscription to fail with the following message:

php
Copy code
JSON returned from channel-authorization endpoint was invalid, yet status code was 200. Data was: <!DOCTYPE html>...
Why This Is Happening:
The /pusher/auth endpoint is likely misconfigured or not properly handling the request.
The response may be returning HTML from Vite's dev server or React app instead of the JSON Pusher expects.
The issue can arise from one of the following:
Route Not Defined Correctly – The /pusher/auth route might not be matching the request, causing the default React route to render instead.
Middleware/Session Issue – If authentication is required and fails, the app might return a login page or error page.
Static File Interference – If Vite's build or express.static is intercepting requests, it could serve the main app HTML.
How to Fix It:
1. Confirm the /pusher/auth Route is Correctly Defined:
Ensure that the /pusher/auth endpoint exists and responds with JSON.

In your backend route file (e.g., pusherAuth.ts or routes.ts):

javascript
Copy code
router.post("/pusher/auth", (req, res) => {
  const socketId = req.body.socket_id;
  const channel = req.body.channel_name;

  // Verify user session or guest
  if (!req.user) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  // Presence data for authenticated user
  const presenceData = {
    user_id: req.user.id,
    user_info: {
      name: req.user.name,
      avatar: req.user.avatar || "/default-avatar.png",
    },
  };

  try {
    const auth = pusher.authenticate(socketId, channel, presenceData);
    res.json(auth);  // Ensure JSON response
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Pusher Auth Error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to authenticate" });
  }
});
2. Add Debugging to Ensure the Route is Hit:
Add a console log to confirm that the /pusher/auth route is being executed and not falling back to a default HTML route.

javascript
Copy code
router.post("/pusher/auth", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Pusher Auth Route Hit");  // Log to confirm route is hit

  const socketId = req.body.socket_id;
  const channel = req.body.channel_name;

  if (!req.user) {
    console.error("Unauthorized Access to Pusher Auth");
    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  const presenceData = {
    user_id: req.user.id,
    user_info: {
      name: req.user.name,
    },
  };

  const auth = pusher.authenticate(socketId, channel, presenceData);
  console.log("Auth Response:", auth);
  res.json(auth);
});
3. Check Vite’s Catch-All Route (Potential Cause):
If Vite is configured to handle unknown routes and return the React app, the /pusher/auth POST request might be falling through to Vite’s catch-all route.

Check your server file (e.g., server.ts or index.ts):

javascript
Copy code
// This might intercept requests and serve the frontend app
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "dist", "index.html"));
});
To Fix: Ensure /pusher/auth is excluded from the catch-all handler by adding this above the static route handler.

javascript
Copy code
app.post("/pusher/auth", router);
