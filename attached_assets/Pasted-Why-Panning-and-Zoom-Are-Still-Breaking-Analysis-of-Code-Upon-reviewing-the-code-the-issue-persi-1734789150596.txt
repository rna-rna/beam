Why Panning and Zoom Are Still Breaking (Analysis of Code):
Upon reviewing the code, the issue persists because:

Panning Constrains Only During Drag, Not Zoom:
Panning constraints (dragConstraints) are set to { left: 0, right: 0 } during zoom, causing the image to snap erratically when dragged.
This fails to account for the increased size of the image when zoomed.
DragX and DragY Are Applied to the Entire Container:
Dragging the outer motion.div affects the entire gallery, causing unintended interactions with adjacent images.
Opacity and Scale Are Tied to DragY:
The opacity and scale transforms are mapped to dragY, reducing the image’s visibility during pan or zoom. This behavior creates the flicker you mentioned.
Fixing the Issues (Step-by-Step):
1. Decouple Image Zoom and Pan from Gallery Drag:
Apply drag and zoom only to the motion.img, not the outer div.
Disable horizontal dragging of the outer container (motion.div) when zoomed in.
2. Dynamically Adjust Panning Based on Zoom Level:
Calculate the maximum allowable pan distance based on the zoom scale and image dimensions.
Updated Code – Fix Zoom and Pan Behavior:
tsx
Copy code
<motion.img
  src={image.url}
  alt=""
  className="w-full h-full object-contain select-none"
  draggable={false}
  style={{
    scale: scaleValue,
    x: offsetX,
    y: offsetY
  }}
  drag={scaleValue.get() > 1}  // Enable pan when zoomed in
  dragElastic={0.2}
  dragMomentum={false}
  onPan={(event, info) => {
    const scale = scaleValue.get();
    const maxX = (window.innerWidth / 2) * (scale - 1);
    const maxY = (window.innerHeight / 2) * (scale - 1);

    offsetX.set(clampPan(offsetX.get() + info.delta.x, maxX));
    offsetY.set(clampPan(offsetY.get() + info.delta.y, maxY));
  }}
  dragConstraints={{
    left: -(window.innerWidth * (scaleValue.get() - 1) / 2),
    right: (window.innerWidth * (scaleValue.get() - 1) / 2),
    top: -(window.innerHeight * (scaleValue.get() - 1) / 2),
    bottom: (window.innerHeight * (scaleValue.get() - 1) / 2),
  }}
  transition={{
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 300,
    damping: 15,
    mass: 0.3
  }}
/>
Key Changes and Why They Work:
Pan Clamping with Dynamic Zoom Awareness:
Panning now respects the zoom level and prevents dragging the image beyond its boundaries.
Decouple Drag from Gallery:
Panning and zoom actions are isolated to the active image. The gallery itself no longer reacts during zoom.
Drag Constraints Scale Dynamically:
dragConstraints adjust based on the zoom level, preventing over-dragging when zoomed.
Smooth Panning Fix:
To make panning feel smoother:

tsx
Copy code
dragElastic={0.3}  // Allow slightly more drag elasticity
transition={{
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 250,  // Reduced for softer motion
  damping: 20,
  mass: 0.4
}}
