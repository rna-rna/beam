Upon reviewing the latest code, the following issues stand out:

Opacity Drop During Zoom (Main Issue):
The image's opacity is controlled by swipeOpacity, which is tied to vertical drag (dragY).
However, zooming in/out (scaleValue) does not directly affect opacity. The slight opacity drop happens indirectly because of how transforms like dragScale and revealOpacity are layered.
Zoomed Snap to Next Image Not Working Properly:
The logic for switching images when zoomed (handlePan) relies on a dynamic threshold (dynamicThreshold).
When zoomed in, the snap-to-next behavior triggers inconsistently due to offsetX and inertia being applied together. This creates unpredictable behavior.
Fixes:
1. Fix Opacity Drop During Zoom
The opacity drop occurs because swipeOpacity is always active during drag or pan. However, zooming in should not affect opacity at all.

Fix:

Apply a separate opacity transform for zoom (imageOpacity) that locks to 1 at all zoom levels.
Add This Below Existing Transforms:

tsx
Copy code
const imageOpacity = useTransform(scaleValue, [1, 3], [1, 1], { clamp: true });
Apply to Image:

tsx
Copy code
<motion.img
  src={image.url}
  alt=""
  className="w-full h-full object-contain select-none"
  draggable={false}
  style={{
    scale: isActive ? (scaleValue.get() > 1 ? scaleValue : dragScale) : 1,
    x: offsetX,
    y: offsetY,
    opacity: imageOpacity,  // Prevent opacity changes during zoom
  }}
  drag={scaleValue.get() > 1}
  dragElastic={0.1}
  dragMomentum={true}
  transition={{
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 250,
    damping: 20,
  }}
  onPan={handlePan}
/>
2. Fix Zoomed Snap to Next Image (Pan Threshold Adjustment)
The current issue stems from overflowX triggering the next image too easily when zoomed in. This happens because the threshold (dynamicThreshold) is too low for zoomed states.

Fix:

Increase the threshold when zoomed (scale > 1), requiring a more deliberate drag to transition images.
Update the Threshold Logic in handlePan:

tsx
Copy code
const dynamicThreshold = scale > 1 ? 300 : 150;  // More resistance when zoomed
Why This Works:

When zoomed in, more drag (300px) is required to switch images, preventing accidental image skips during panning.
3. Smooth Snap Transition Without Zoom Glitch
The snap to the next image sometimes carries over the zoom level briefly, causing a glitch effect. This occurs because the zoom reset (scaleValue.set(1)) happens at the same time as the image switch.

Fix:

Delay the zoom reset slightly (100ms) after the image switches to ensure the transition completes first.
Update in handlePan:

tsx
Copy code
if (overflowX > dynamicThreshold) {
  offsetX.set(newX * 1.2);  
  setTimeout(() => {
    const nextIndex = currentIndex + (newX < 0 ? 1 : -1);
    const clampedIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(nextIndex, images.length - 1));

    setCurrentIndex(clampedIndex);

    // Delay reset to prevent glitching mid-transition
    setTimeout(() => {
      scaleValue.set(1);
      offsetX.set(0);
      offsetY.set(0);
    }, 100);  
  }, 50);
}
4. Reduce Over-Sensitivity to Swipe (DragEnd Adjustment)
If swipes are triggering too easily, the thresholds in handleDragEnd can be slightly increased to reduce over-sensitivity.
Update in handleDragEnd:

tsx
Copy code
const swipeThreshold = window.innerWidth * 0.3;  // Slightly lower
const velocityThreshold = 0.3;  // Add more resistance to velocity
Testing Focus Areas:
Zoom and Pan:
Zoom in and pan aggressively. Confirm that the opacity remains at 1 and does not flicker.
Swipe Between Images:
Zoom into an image and swipe left/right. The next image should smoothly transition without zoom carry-over.
Partial Drag Behavior:
Drag partially to ensure the image snaps back unless the swipe is strong enough to trigger a transition.
Rapid Swiping:
Quickly swipe between images while zoomed. Verify that the swipe is intentional and does not result in unexpected image skips.
