After reviewing the latest version of MobileGalleryView.tsx, the main issues contributing to the broken swipe and zoom behavior are:

Zoom Carrying Over to Next Image (Scale Persistence):
The zoom level (scaleValue) persists even when swiping to the next image. This causes the next image to appear at the zoomed state instead of resetting to the default zoom level.
Pan/Offset Persistence:
offsetX and offsetY are reset on swipe, but this happens at the same time as the image transition, causing visual artifacts (like the image "falling off" during the transition).
Springy Swipe Transition (Too Responsive):
The transition to the next image uses a spring with low stiffness and damping, making it feel overly elastic and allowing accidental swipes.
Fixing the Issues:
1. Fix Zoom Persistence (Reset Zoom at Transition Start):
The key is to reset scaleValue immediately before triggering the next image transition. Currently, the reset happens inside handlePan and handleDragEnd, but the zoom lingers until the swipe completes.

Fix:

Reset scaleValue right before setting the next image:
tsx
Copy code
if (shouldChangeImage) {
  const nextIndex = currentIndex + (xOffset > 0 ? -1 : 1);
  const clampedIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(nextIndex, images.length - 1));

  // Reset zoom before switching images
  scaleValue.set(1);
  offsetX.set(0);
  offsetY.set(0);

  setCurrentIndex(clampedIndex);
}
2. Smoothly Reset Pan/Offset After Transition (Prevent Falling Effect):
The current code immediately resets the offset and zoom when transitioning. This creates a jarring "snap" effect. The fix is to delay the reset slightly using a setTimeout or animate it smoothly with a spring.

Fix:

tsx
Copy code
setTimeout(() => {
  scaleValue.set(1, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
  offsetX.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
  offsetY.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
}, 50);  // Short delay to ensure smooth transition
3. Adjust Swipe Sensitivity (Prevent Over-Sensitive Swipes):
Currently, swipes trigger with low resistance (swipeThreshold = 0.3 * window.innerWidth). This makes swiping to the next image feel too easy, especially when zoomed in.

Fix (Increase Swipe Threshold):

tsx
Copy code
const swipeThreshold = window.innerWidth * 0.4;  // Require a more intentional swipe
const velocityThreshold = 0.35;  // Slightly increase required velocity
Updated Code (Key Sections for Fixes):
tsx
Copy code
const handleDragEnd = (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent | PointerEvent, info: PanInfo) => {
  const xOffset = info.offset.x;
  const yOffset = info.offset.y;
  const velocity = info.velocity.x;

  if (Math.abs(yOffset) > 150 && Math.abs(xOffset) < 50) {
    onClose();
    return;
  }

  const swipeThreshold = window.innerWidth * 0.4;  // Increased threshold
  const velocityThreshold = 0.35;

  const shouldChangeImage =
    Math.abs(velocity) > velocityThreshold || Math.abs(xOffset) > swipeThreshold;

  if (shouldChangeImage) {
    const nextIndex = currentIndex + (xOffset > 0 ? -1 : 1);
    const clampedIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(nextIndex, images.length - 1));

    // Reset zoom and position immediately before transition
    scaleValue.set(1);
    offsetX.set(0);
    offsetY.set(0);

    setCurrentIndex(clampedIndex);

    // Smooth reset after image switches to avoid snap
    setTimeout(() => {
      scaleValue.set(1, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
      offsetX.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
      offsetY.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
    }, 50);
  }

  dragX.set(0);
  dragY.set(0);
  setIsDragging(false);
};
Testing the Fixes:
Zoom and Swipe:
Zoom into an image and swipe left/right. The next image should appear at default zoom (1x) without lingering zoom effects.
Swipe Sensitivity:
Test swiping between images to ensure that swipes feel controlled and intentional.
Transition Smoothness:
Rapidly swipe between images and zoom in/out. Ensure no images "fall off" or behave erratically.
