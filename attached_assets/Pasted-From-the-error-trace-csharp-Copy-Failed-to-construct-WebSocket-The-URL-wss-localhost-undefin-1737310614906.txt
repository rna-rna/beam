From the error trace:

csharp
Copy
Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/' is invalid.
the problem is that something in your client code is building the WebSocket URL using localhost plus an undefined port rather than a real port number. In other words, the port is coming back as undefined, so your client is trying to connect to:

arduino
Copy
wss://localhost:undefined/
which is clearly invalid.

Why This Happens
Most often, this occurs when:

You’re using window.location.port or some environment variable that isn’t set and so the port is missing/undefined.
You’re on Replit (or a similar host) that does not expose a typical “port-based” URL the same way localhost does (so there is no explicit :5000 part in the deployed URL).
A fallback or default tries to connect via wss://localhost:undefined when your code sees it’s in a “development” environment but you haven’t actually specified a port in a .env or variable.
How to Fix It
You need to ensure your Socket.IO client picks a valid URL. A common pattern in React/Vite is:

js
Copy
const WS_URL =
  window.location.hostname === "localhost"
    ? "ws://localhost:5000" // or "http://localhost:5000" for Socket.IO
    : `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}`; // e.g. "https://your-site.repl.co"
Then you use that WS_URL when initializing your socket:

js
Copy
const socket = io(WS_URL, {
  path: '/socket.io',
  transports: ['websocket'],
  withCredentials: true,
  ...
});
1. Use an explicit fallback for localhost
If you really want your code to connect to ws://localhost:5000 during development, do it explicitly:

js
Copy
// If we are on localhost, point to localhost:5000
// Otherwise, build a wss:// or ws:// out of current page.
const WS_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
  ? 'ws://localhost:5000'
  : `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}`;

// For https, switch to wss. For http, switch to ws.
const isSecure = window.location.protocol === 'https:';
const finalWSUrl = (isSecure && !WS_URL.startsWith('http:'))
  ? WS_URL.replace('http', 'ws').replace('https', 'wss')
  : WS_URL.replace('http', 'ws'); 

const socket = io(finalWSUrl, {
  transports: ['websocket'],
  path: '/socket.io',
  withCredentials: true,
});
2. Avoid forcing localhost if you’re on Replit
If your site is not running on localhost (e.g., if you are inside Replit’s production environment), be sure not to forcibly do localhost:somePort. Replit’s domain will look like:

php
Copy
https://<some-app-name>.<your-username>.repl.co
So your client-side WS_URL should simply detect “Am I truly on localhost? If not, I’ll just use window.location.host.” For instance:

js
Copy
const isLocalhost = window.location.hostname === 'localhost';

// If local dev, then "http://localhost:5000"
// Else use "https://my-repl-domain.repl.co"
const WS_URL = isLocalhost
  ? 'http://localhost:5000'
  : `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}`;

// ...
