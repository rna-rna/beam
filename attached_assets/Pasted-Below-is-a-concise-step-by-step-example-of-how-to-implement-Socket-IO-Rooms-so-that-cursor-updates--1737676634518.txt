Below is a concise, step‐by‐step example of how to implement Socket.IO Rooms so that cursor updates (and any other real‐time events) only go to users in the same gallery.

1. Server‐Side: Listen for “Join” Events and Put Sockets into Rooms
Your server might look something like this:

js
Copy
// server.js or wherever you configure Socket.IO
const express = require("express");
const http = require("http");
const { Server } = require("socket.io");

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server, {
  // Any Socket.IO server config you need
});

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log(`Socket connected: ${socket.id}`);

  // When the client says "join-gallery", put this socket in that "room"
  socket.on("join-gallery", (gallerySlug) => {
    socket.join(gallerySlug);
    console.log(`Socket ${socket.id} joined room: ${gallerySlug}`);
  });

  // (Optional) Handle "leave-gallery" event if you want explicit leaving
  socket.on("leave-gallery", (gallerySlug) => {
    socket.leave(gallerySlug);
    console.log(`Socket ${socket.id} left room: ${gallerySlug}`);
  });

  // Now, when we get a cursor update, broadcast it only to *other* users
  // in the same gallery room.
  socket.on("cursor-update", (cursorData) => {
    // cursorData should include `gallerySlug`
    // so we know which room to broadcast to:
    const { gallerySlug } = cursorData;
    if (!gallerySlug) return;
    
    // Send to everyone in the same room except this user
    socket.to(gallerySlug).emit("cursor-update", cursorData);
  });

  // If a socket disconnects, log it
  socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    console.log(`Socket disconnected: ${socket.id}`);
  });
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port 3000");
});
Notes
We assume each gallery corresponds to a “room.” You can name the room gallery:${slug} or just use the slug directly if that is unique.
socket.join(gallerySlug) is how Socket.IO logically groups connections.
socket.to(gallerySlug).emit(...) sends an event to everyone in that room except the socket that sent it.
