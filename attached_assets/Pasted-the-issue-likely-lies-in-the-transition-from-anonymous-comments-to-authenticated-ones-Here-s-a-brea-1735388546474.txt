the issue likely lies in the transition from anonymous comments to authenticated ones. Here's a breakdown of potential problem areas and fixes:

1. Authentication Check for Comment Submission
In CommentBubble.tsx:

tsx
Copy code
if (text.trim() && onSubmit) {
  onSubmit(text, savedAuthor || author || "Anonymous");
}
Problem: This fallback to "Anonymous" may allow unauthenticated comments.
Fix: Ensure that the savedAuthor or author must be set to the currently authenticated user.
Modify to:

tsx
Copy code
if (text.trim() && onSubmit) {
  if (!savedAuthor && !author) {
    alert("You must be signed in to comment.");
    return;
  }
  onSubmit(text, savedAuthor || author);
}
2. Comment Creation â€“ Ensure User Association
In Gallery (22).tsx, the createCommentMutation uses:

tsx
Copy code
body: JSON.stringify({
  content,
  xPosition: x,
  yPosition: y
}),
credentials: 'include'
Problem: This relies on session cookies, but if Clerk.dev isn't passing the user ID, the comment could remain anonymous.
Fix: Explicitly attach the user ID when creating a comment.
Add the user ID to the request:

tsx
Copy code
const user = useUser();
body: JSON.stringify({
  content,
  xPosition: x,
  yPosition: y,
  userId: user?.user?.id
}),
Ensure the server checks for userId and returns an error if not provided.

3. Authenticated User Requirement
In App (7).tsx:

tsx
Copy code
<Route path="/g/:slug">
  {(params) => (
    <ProtectedRoute>
Good: This already restricts access to authenticated users.
However, you should ensure commenting components explicitly check for isSignedIn from Clerk.

4. Comment Display (Proper Attribution)
In CommentBubble.tsx:

tsx
Copy code
<UserAvatar name={author || "Anonymous"} />
<p>{author || "Anonymous"}</p>
Fix: If no author exists, hide the comment box instead:
tsx
Copy code
{author ? (
  <>
    <UserAvatar name={author} />
    <p>{author}</p>
  </>
) : (
  <p className="text-red-500">Invalid Comment - User Required</p>
)}
5. Protected Comment Submission
In Gallery (21).tsx:

tsx
Copy code
<ProtectedRoute>
  <Gallery />
</ProtectedRoute>
This already protects gallery access, but ensure the comment input is also disabled if !isSignedIn.
Example:

tsx
Copy code
{isSignedIn ? (
  <Textarea placeholder="Add your comment" />
) : (
  <p className="text-muted">Sign in to comment.</p>
)}
