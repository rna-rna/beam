A common reason for “infinite” preloads or repeated calls to the IntersectionObserver callback is that your <ImageComponent> (and therefore the observer) is being re-mounted or re-initialized on every render. In other words, React keeps tearing down the old observer and creating a new one in rapid succession, causing the preloadCallback to fire again and again.

Below are some practical fixes and checks you can do to stop that constant reloading:

1. Guard Against Repeated Preloads in Your Callback
If your goal is a “one-time” preload per image, you need to ensure the callback only runs once per image. A simple way is to store a small piece of state or a Set of IDs so that once you’ve preloaded an image, you never run its preload again. For example:

tsx
Copy
Edit
function ImageComponent({ image, index }: { image: ImageOrPending; index: number }) {
  const [hasPreloaded, setHasPreloaded] = useState(false);

  const preloadCallback = useCallback(() => {
    // 1) Early return if we already preloaded
    if (hasPreloaded) return;

    setHasPreloaded(true);

    // 2) Actually do your preload
    const optimizedUrl =
      "localUrl" in image ? image.localUrl : getR2Image(image, "lightbox");

    console.log("Preloading optimized image:", optimizedUrl);
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = optimizedUrl;
  }, [hasPreloaded, image]);

  const intersectionRef = useIntersectionPreload(preloadCallback);

  return (
    <div ref={intersectionRef} className="..." /* the rest of your component */>
      {/* render the thumbnail */}
    </div>
  );
}
By using hasPreloaded and checking it in preloadCallback, each <ImageComponent> instance will preload exactly once. Even if React re-renders and “re-subscribes” the observer, the callback bails out immediately.

2. Avoid Passing Unstable Objects to the Callback
Notice you do:

js
Copy
Edit
const preloadCallback = useCallback(() => {
  const optimizedUrl = "localUrl" in image
    ? image.localUrl
    : getR2Image(image, "lightbox");
  ...
}, [image]);
If image is a brand new object reference on every render (for example, if you reconstruct or spread it somewhere else in the parent), then useCallback will keep getting a new dependency. That means React tears down the old observer and sets up a new observer each time.

One remedy: Pass only stable pieces (like image.id and image.url) instead of the entire image object, or make sure that image is memoized/stable in the parent so that its reference does not change. For instance:

js
Copy
Edit
const preloadCallback = useCallback(() => {
  if (hasPreloaded) return;
  setHasPreloaded(true);

  const optimizedUrl = getR2ImageById(imageId); // just use ID or a stable param
  ...
}, [imageId, hasPreloaded]);
3. Verify You Are Not Doing Two Types of Preload
From your code, it looks like you have two preloading approaches:

A standalone effect that iterates over gallery.images:
js
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  if (!gallery?.images) return;
  gallery.images.forEach((image) => {
    if (!preloadedImages.has(image.id)) {
      preloadImage(image, image.id);
    }
  });
}, [gallery?.images, preloadImage, preloadedImages]);
An intersection-based preload in <ImageComponent>.
Often you only need one of these. If you’re preloading all images upfront in a loop, there isn’t much reason to also set up an intersection-based observer in each <ImageComponent>. That can cause duplication or “double dipping” in preloads—potentially spamming your logs.

So, decide which approach you want:

Intersection-based “lazy” preload (preloads only if the image is actually in the viewport).
Global “preload everything” approach in a single useEffect.
If you keep both, you can easily end up reloading/logging the same item repeatedly.

4. Check for Parent Re-renders Triggering New Observers
A final detail: even if your callback is stable, if the parent rebuilds the <ImageComponent> array on every render (e.g., by doing map(...) on a new array each time), you might still see repeated unmount/mount cycles.

Make sure you are not constantly creating new references in the parent—for instance, by spreading images into a new array or reconstructing them in useMemo incorrectly. Keep them stable so React sees the same identity across renders.

Quick Summary of the Most Common Fix
Inside <ImageComponent>: Add a small flag to skip re-preloading:
js
Copy
Edit
const [hasPreloaded, setHasPreloaded] = useState(false);
...
if (hasPreloaded) return;
setHasPreloaded(true);
// do the image = new Image(), etc
Do not rebuild the entire image object on every parent render. Provide stable references so the child doesn’t keep unmounting/remounting.
If you also have a global useEffect that preloads images, you probably don’t need intersection-based preloads as well. Pick one or the other.
With these tweaks, the infinite console spam should stop, and you’ll see each image only loaded once.
