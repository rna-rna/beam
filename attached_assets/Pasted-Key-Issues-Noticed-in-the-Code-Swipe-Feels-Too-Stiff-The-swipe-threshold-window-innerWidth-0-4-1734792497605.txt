Key Issues Noticed in the Code:

Swipe Feels Too Stiff:
The swipe threshold (window.innerWidth * 0.4) and velocity threshold (0.4) are making the swipe feel rigid and difficult to trigger, requiring too much effort to move between images.
Zoomed Snap to Next Image Not Working Properly:
The scaleValue resets immediately when swiping (scaleValue.set(1)), but the transition logic is likely conflicting with the pan offsets (offsetX, offsetY).
When zoomed, the swipe to next image doesn’t smoothly transition because the reset occurs abruptly, causing erratic behavior.
Fix 1 – Reduce Swipe Rigidity (Improve Responsiveness)
Lower the swipe threshold and velocity requirement slightly to make the swipe more responsive.
Current (too stiff):
tsx
Copy code
const swipeThreshold = window.innerWidth * 0.4;
const velocityThreshold = 0.4;
Fix (more responsive):
tsx
Copy code
const swipeThreshold = window.innerWidth * 0.25;  // Reduced threshold
const velocityThreshold = 0.25;  // Lowered velocity requirement
Fix 2 – Prevent Zoom Reset from Causing Snap Issues
The main issue arises because scaleValue resets immediately, but the transition between images needs to complete first.
Solution: Delay the zoom reset slightly (100ms) to avoid resetting mid-transition.
Updated Reset in handlePan (Prevent Snap Glitch):

tsx
Copy code
if (overflowX > dynamicThreshold) {
  const nextIndex = currentIndex + (newX < 0 ? 1 : -1);
  const clampedIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(nextIndex, images.length - 1));

  setCurrentIndex(clampedIndex);
  
  // Smooth reset of zoom and offsets after transition
  setTimeout(() => {
    scaleValue.set(1);
    offsetX.set(0);
    offsetY.set(0);
  }, 100);  // Add slight delay to prevent glitching during snap
} else {
  offsetX.set(clampPan(newX, maxX));
  offsetY.set(clampPan(newY, maxY));
}
Fix 3 – Smooth Transition Without Abrupt Reset (Drag End)
Similarly, handleDragEnd resets zoom immediately, but the next image can still be mid-transition.
Solution: Delay the zoom reset only if a new image is triggered.
Updated handleDragEnd (Smooth Zoom Reset):

tsx
Copy code
if (shouldChangeImage) {
  const nextIndex = currentIndex + (xOffset > 0 ? -1 : 1);
  const clampedIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(nextIndex, images.length - 1));

  setCurrentIndex(clampedIndex);

  // Delay reset to avoid snapping issue
  setTimeout(() => {
    scaleValue.set(1);
    offsetX.set(0);
    offsetY.set(0);
  }, 100);
} else {
  dragX.set(0, {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 300,
    damping: 25,
  });
  dragY.set(0, {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 300,
    damping: 25,
  });
}
Fix 4 – Keep Adjacent Images from Sliding When Zoomed
When zoomed in, swiping sometimes pulls adjacent images slightly, causing instability.
Solution: Lock adjacent images to their position unless they are transitioning.
Adjust motion.div Animation (Lock Adjacent Images):

tsx
Copy code
animate={{
  x: isActive ? dragX.get() : index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
  scale: isActive ? (scaleValue.get() > 1 ? scaleValue : dragScale) : 1,  // Lock adjacent images at 1
  opacity: 1,
  transition: {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 300,
    damping: 25,
  },
}}
