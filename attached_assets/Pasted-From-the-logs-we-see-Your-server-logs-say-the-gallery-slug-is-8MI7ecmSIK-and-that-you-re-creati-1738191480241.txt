From the logs, we see:

Your server logs say the gallery slug is "8MI7ecmSIK" and that you’re creating a new invite with "gallerySlug": "8MI7ecmSIK".
The front-end log shows a final notification object without gallerySlug. You see galleryTitle: "Social" but no gallerySlug field at all.
This confirms that somewhere in your flow, the slug is not making it into the final notif.data that the front end receives. Here are the most common reasons:

1. You’re Overwriting or Not Merging the Fresh gallerySlug in addNotification
If you have logic similar to:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (existing) {
  const updatedData = {
    ...existing.data,
    // BUT forgetting to merge the new data from the latest call
    count: ((existing.data as any).count || 1) + 1,
    lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
  }
  ...
}
You are discarding any new fields (like gallerySlug) that were part of the latest notification payload. You must merge the new data:

diff
Copy
Edit
const updatedData = {
  ...existing.data,
+ ...data, // This ensures new fields like gallerySlug are merged in
  count: ((existing.data as any).count || 1) + 1,
  lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
};
Otherwise, your old notification row stays in place with no gallerySlug.

2. The Old Notification Row Is Being Re-Used
Because you’re likely re-inviting the same user and using the same groupId within a certain time window, the server code sees an “existing” notification, updates only parts of its data, and never sets gallerySlug.

Easy fix:

Delete or mark as isSeen: true the old notification row so that the server is forced to create a brand-new row with the correct data (including gallerySlug).
Or make sure you do the ...data merge above.
3. The gallery?.slug is Actually Null or Empty
In your code:

ts
Copy
Edit
gallerySlug: gallery?.slug || ''
If your DB column for that gallery is null or never set, you end up with "". Since an empty string is falsy, React’s condition

tsx
Copy
Edit
{notif.data?.gallerySlug && (
  <a href={`/g/${notif.data.gallerySlug}`}>
    View Project
  </a>
)}
never shows. Worse, if you’re reusing an existing row, it might be locked into that empty value forever unless you do the merge fix from #1.

4. Double-Check the Notification Type
You are correctly checking:

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (notif.type === "gallery-invite") {
  /* show the link */
}
If the server is somehow setting a different type, it would skip that block. But your logs show type: "gallery-invite", so likely this part is correct.
