This error:

sql
Copy
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "cached_users_pkey"
occurs because two concurrent inserts into your cached_users table are trying to create the same user_id row at roughly the same time. Since user_id is the primary key (unique), you get a collision. Essentially, you’re inserting a user row that already exists in the database.

Below is why it happens and how to fix it:

1. Why You’re Seeing This
Concurrent or Duplicate Fetches: Multiple requests might be calling your fetchCachedUserData function in parallel for the same user IDs. Each tries to insert a row that doesn’t exist (according to each request’s local check), and they race each other to run INSERT at nearly the same moment.

Missing “Upsert” Logic: Right now, you likely have something like:

ts
Copy
await db.insert(cachedUsers).values({
  userId: user.id,
  ...
});
with no “on conflict do update” or “upsert” logic. So if the row is inserted by one request, a second request sees the old data (or sees the row missing) and tries to insert it again.

No Locking or Memoization: If multiple fetches for the same user come in concurrently, none of them see that the user is about to be inserted, so they all do it.

2. The Standard Solution: Use an “Upsert”
If you’re using Drizzle ORM with Postgres, you can do something like:

ts
Copy
await db
  .insert(cachedUsers)
  .values({
    userId: user.id,
    firstName: user.firstName,
    lastName: user.lastName,
    imageUrl: user.imageUrl,
    color: someColor,
    updatedAt: new Date()
  })
  .onConflictDoUpdate({
    // specify your conflict target
    target: cachedUsers.userId,
    // specify how you want to update existing rows
    set: {
      firstName: user.firstName,
      lastName: user.lastName,
      imageUrl: user.imageUrl,
      color: someColor,
      updatedAt: new Date()
    },
  });
When Postgres sees a conflict on user_id, it will run UPDATE instead of failing with duplicate key value violates unique constraint.

If Drizzle Doesn’t Have a Direct “onConflict”
Some versions of Drizzle or other ORMs require raw SQL or a different syntax. For instance, you can do:

sql
Copy
INSERT INTO cached_users (user_id, first_name, last_name, image_url, updated_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE
  SET first_name = EXCLUDED.first_name,
      last_name = EXCLUDED.last_name,
      image_url = EXCLUDED.image_url,
      updated_at = EXCLUDED.updated_at
Either way, that’s the “upsert” logic you need.
