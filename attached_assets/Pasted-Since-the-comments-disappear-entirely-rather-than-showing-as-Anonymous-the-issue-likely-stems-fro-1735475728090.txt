Since the comments disappear entirely rather than showing as "Anonymous," the issue likely stems from the conditional rendering logic in CommentBubble.tsx or comment fetching in Gallery.tsx.

Root Cause:
Conditional Check Prevents Rendering:
tsx
Copy code
if (!authorDisplay && !isNew) {
  return null;
}
If the authorDisplay is null or undefined, the comment doesn't render.
This applies to both optimistic comments and fetched comments from the backend.
If the backend response is delayed or missing author data temporarily, the comment vanishes.
Fix – Ensure Comments Always Render:
1. Relax Conditional Rendering in CommentBubble.tsx:
Update the condition to prevent comments from disappearing:
tsx
Copy code
if (!authorDisplay && !isNew) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-card p-2 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <p className="text-xs font-medium text-muted-foreground">Unknown User</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-foreground">{content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
Why This Works:
Instead of returning null, a placeholder comment renders even if the author data is missing.
This ensures that previous comments without author fields still appear.
2. Ensure Optimistic Comments Persist Until Overwritten:
In the onSuccess block (after submitting a comment):
tsx
Copy code
onSuccess: (data) => {
  queryClient.setQueryData([`/api/images/${imageId}/comments`], (old: any[] = []) => {
    return old.map((comment) =>
      comment.optimistic && comment.content === data.data.content
        ? {
            ...data.data,
            author: data.data.author || comment.author // Preserve the optimistic author
          }
        : comment
    );
  });
};
Why This Helps:
If the backend response lacks the author temporarily, the frontend keeps the optimistic comment visible until the backend propagates the correct data.
3. Prevent Overwriting Comments During Refetch (Gallery.tsx):
In Gallery.tsx, adjust the query to ensure existing comments are not discarded during refetch:
tsx
Copy code
select: (data) => {
  return data.map((comment) => ({
    ...comment,
    author: comment.author && typeof comment.author === 'object'
      ? comment.author
      : {
          username: "Unknown User",
          id: "unknown",
          imageUrl: undefined
        }
  }));
}
Why This Helps:
Even if the backend returns incomplete data, the comment persists with a fallback user.
4. Handle Missing Author Gracefully (Optional UI Improvement):
If the author is missing, display "Unknown User" in CommentBubble.tsx:
tsx
Copy code
<p className="text-xs font-medium text-muted-foreground">
  {authorDisplay?.username || "Unknown User"}
</p>
Why:
Comments without authors still render instead of disappearing.
Testing the Fix:
Submit a Comment – Ensure it remains visible even during the refetch process.
Refresh the Page – All previously submitted comments should load, even without author data.
Simulate Missing Author Data:
Temporarily remove the author join from the API to simulate the issue.
javascript
Copy code
const comments = await db.query.comments.findMany({
  where: { imageId: req.params.id }
  // Author join temporarily disabled
});
Ensure that comments still display with "Unknown User."
