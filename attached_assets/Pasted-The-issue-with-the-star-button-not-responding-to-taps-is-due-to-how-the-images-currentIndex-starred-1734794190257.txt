The issue with the star button not responding to taps is due to how the images[currentIndex].starred state is managed. While the visual reflects the state correctly, the button press doesn’t trigger a star mutation consistently.

Why It’s Not Working:
The Mutation Logic Exists (starMutation) – The mutation is correctly defined using useMutation but is never directly linked to the button interaction.
Button OnClick Doesn't Trigger the Mutation Properly –
The button tries to toggle the star visually based on the current image state, but the mutation isn't triggered consistently.
Fix – Ensure the Star Button Toggles with Mutation
The mutation function (toggleStarImage) exists but isn't tightly coupled to the button logic. Let's ensure the mutation runs directly when the button is tapped.

Code Update:
Update the Star Button to Trigger Mutation Properly:

tsx
Copy code
<button
  onClick={toggleStarImage}  // Trigger the mutation directly
  className={`transition-colors ${
    images[currentIndex].starred
      ? 'text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300'
      : 'text-white/90 hover:text-white'
  }`}
>
  <Star
    className="w-5 h-5"
    fill={images[currentIndex].starred ? "currentColor" : "none"}
  />
</button>
Key Fixes in Logic:
Direct Mutation Trigger:
Tapping the star button directly triggers the mutation (toggleStarImage), ensuring the state change reflects consistently across the app.
Visual Feedback:
The button immediately reflects the change by toggling the star color (text-yellow-400).
Slick Animation on Button Press:
To add subtle iOS-like feedback when starring:

Add a slight scale animation to the star on press. This improves user interaction without being overly dramatic.
Add Animation to the Button:

tsx
Copy code
<motion.button
  onClick={toggleStarImage}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.85 }}  // Shrink slightly on tap
  className={`transition-colors ${
    images[currentIndex].starred
      ? 'text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300'
      : 'text-white/90 hover:text-white'
  }`}
>
  <Star
    className="w-5 h-5"
    fill={images[currentIndex].starred ? "currentColor" : "none"}
  />
</motion.button>
Testing Focus:
Star Toggle Feedback:
Tap the star button and confirm it immediately toggles visually.
Verify that the star state updates across sessions (using the API call).
Animation Smoothness:
Confirm the star scales smoothly when tapped without disrupting the swipe/zoom behavior.
State Consistency:
Starred images should retain their state when swiping between images and persist after refreshing the gallery.
Optional Enhancements:
Add Haptic Feedback on Star Tap (Mobile):
tsx
Copy code
if ('vibrate' in navigator) {
  navigator.vibrate(50);  // Trigger subtle haptic feedback
}
Animate Opacity Change:
Slightly fade the star during the tap for a smoother interaction:
tsx
Copy code
whileTap={{ opacity: 0.8 }}
