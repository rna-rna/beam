Upon reviewing the code, the issue where comments briefly show the correct author and then revert to "Anonymous" likely stems from how the select function in Gallery.tsx processes the comment data during the refetch. This happens after the optimistic update logic in CommentBubble.tsx.

Key Areas of Concern:
Gallery.tsx – Comment Fetch Logic (Author Mapping):
tsx
Copy code
select: (data) => {
  return data.map((comment) => {
    const existingAuthor = comment.author;
    return {
      ...comment,
      author: existingAuthor && typeof existingAuthor === 'object'
        ? existingAuthor
        : {
            username: existingAuthor
              ? String(existingAuthor)
              : "Anonymous",
            id: existingAuthor
              ? String(existingAuthor)
              : "anonymous",
            imageUrl: undefined
          }
    };
  });
}
Problem:
This mapping overwrites the author with "Anonymous" if the backend response doesn't properly nest the author object.
Even if the API returns author: { username: "John Doe" }, if the existingAuthor is a string or misformatted, it defaults to the fallback.
CommentBubble.tsx – Optimistic Update Logic:
tsx
Copy code
onSuccess: (data) => {
  queryClient.setQueryData([`/api/images/${imageId}/comments`], (old: any[] = []) => {
    return old.map((comment) =>
      comment.optimistic && comment.content === data.data.content
        ? {
            ...data.data,
            author: data.data.author && typeof data.data.author === 'object'
              ? data.data.author
              : comment.author  // Preserve optimistic author
          }
        : comment
    );
  });
}
Problem:
If the backend response lacks proper nesting of author, the optimistic author is overwritten incorrectly.
Why the Issue Occurs:
During the refetch, the backend response might include author as a string or improperly formatted object.
Frontend Mapping Logic then replaces the correct author with "Anonymous" due to the fallback condition.
Result: Comments temporarily show the correct author (from the optimistic update) but revert to "Anonymous" post-refetch.
Fix – Ensure Proper Author Handling and Preserve Optimistic Update:
1. Adjust Gallery.tsx to Avoid Overwriting Valid Authors:
Modify the select function to only apply fallback if author is truly missing or null:
tsx
Copy code
select: (data) => {
  return data.map((comment) => {
    return {
      ...comment,
      author: comment.author && typeof comment.author === 'object'
        ? comment.author
        : comment.author && typeof comment.author === 'string'
        ? { username: comment.author, id: comment.author }
        : {
            username: "Anonymous",
            id: "anonymous",
            imageUrl: undefined
          }
    };
  });
}
Why This Works:
This logic prevents overwriting valid author objects while preserving string-based authors (e.g., author: "John Doe").
2. Modify CommentBubble.tsx to Retain Optimistic Author if Backend Response Lacks It:
Ensure the backend response doesn't overwrite the optimistic author:
tsx
Copy code
onSuccess: (data) => {
  queryClient.setQueryData([`/api/images/${imageId}/comments`], (old: any[] = []) => {
    return old.map((comment) =>
      comment.optimistic && comment.content === data.data.content
        ? {
            ...data.data,
            author: data.data.author
              ? data.data.author
              : comment.author  // Retain optimistic author if backend lacks one
          }
        : comment
    );
  });
}
Why This Works:
This ensures that the optimistic comment’s author is preserved until the backend reliably returns the correct author.
3. Verify Backend API Response for Proper Author Nesting:
In the API route handling comment fetching (routes.ts or similar):
javascript
Copy code
const comments = await db.query.comments.findMany({
  where: { imageId: req.params.id },
  include: {
    author: {
      select: {
        username: true,
        imageUrl: true
      }
    }
  }
});
res.json(comments);
Why This Is Important:
This ensures the backend consistently returns the author object properly nested inside the comment.
4. Add Debugging to Track Comment Fetching:
Add Logs to Gallery.tsx to Confirm Correct Author Data:
tsx
Copy code
onSuccess: (data) => {
  console.log("Fetched comments:", data);
}
Expected Output:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 101,
  "content": "Amazing shot!",
  "author": {
    "username": "Jane Doe",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
  }
}
If the console shows author: null or a string, the issue lies in the backend response or query.
