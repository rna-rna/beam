Design Brief: Settings Page Redesign (Figma-Inspired)

Goals
Consolidate Settings: Group all user-related options (profile, avatar, password) under an Account tab, and all notification preferences under a Notifications tab.
Figma-Style Layout: Emulate the clean, minimal, and tab-driven approach of Figma’s settings, using shadcn UI components for consistency with the rest of the app.
Clarity & Intuitiveness: Provide clear visual hierarchy and easy navigation between Account and Notification settings.
Primary Components
Settings Layout Container

A high-level container (e.g., <div className="container ...">) wrapping the entire settings page.
White or light-gray background with subtle shadow (via Card component or a similar container from shadcn).
Tabs Navigation (shadcn)

Use a tabbed interface (e.g., <Tabs>, <TabsList>, <TabsTrigger>, <TabsContent>) from shadcn UI.
Two primary tabs:
Account
Notifications
Account Tab Content

Profile Section:
Avatar preview, file upload for custom avatar.
Editable fields for First/Last name.
Display-only primary email with eventual “Change Email” or “Add Email” CTA if needed.
Security Section:
New/Confirm Password fields, “Change Password” button.
CTA: “Save Changes” or “Update Profile,” aligned consistently (e.g., right-aligned or full-width).
Notifications Tab Content

Notification Settings for:
New invites
Comments on galleries
Starred images
Each category offers In-App and Email toggles (via checkboxes or switches).
A “Save” button that updates all notification preferences together.
Layout & Visual Hierarchy
Header/Title

A clear “Settings” or “Preferences” header at the top of the page, matching the overall app’s typography (e.g., text-2xl font-semibold).
Brief description or subtitle (“Manage your account details and notification preferences”) for context.
Tabs

Positioned below the header, occupying full width, with an accent underline or highlight on the active tab.
Each tab’s content is separated using subtle borders or spacing to visually distinguish different sections.
Sections Within Tabs

Each section (Profile, Security, Notification Groups) has its own heading (text-xl or text-lg).
Group related form elements together with consistent spacing (e.g., space-y-4 or space-y-6).
Buttons & Actions

Use a prominent color (e.g., your “primary” from the design system) for primary actions like “Save” or “Update.”
Use subtle outlines or “secondary” style for less critical actions (e.g., “Cancel” or “Upload Avatar”).
