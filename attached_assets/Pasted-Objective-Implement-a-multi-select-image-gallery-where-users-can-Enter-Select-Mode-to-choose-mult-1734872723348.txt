Objective:
Implement a multi-select image gallery where users can:

Enter Select Mode to choose multiple images using checkboxes.
Delete Selected Images by pressing a delete button that appears when selections are made.
Mimic the intuitive UX of the iOS Photos app, where images dim slightly when selected, and selections can be toggled on or off.
Feature Breakdown:
1. Select Mode (Toggle on/off):
Action: A "Select" button at the top-right corner of the gallery initiates Select Mode.
Behavior:
When clicked, checkboxes appear on each image, allowing users to select multiple photos.
Clicking "Cancel" exits Select Mode and clears any selections.
2. Image Selection:
Checkboxes:
In Select Mode, a circular checkbox appears at the top-right corner of each image.
Tapping a checkbox toggles image selection.
Selected images are visually marked by dimming their opacity.
Dynamic Updates:
Selected image IDs are stored in an array (selectedImages), which updates dynamically as selections change.
3. Delete Functionality:
Action: A delete button appears at the bottom-center of the screen when images are selected.
Behavior:
If no images are selected, the button is disabled.
Tapping "Delete" removes the selected images from the gallery.
The gallery state is updated to reflect the remaining images.
Technical Implementation Overview:
State Management:
useState tracks:
Whether Select Mode is active (selectMode).
IDs of selected images (selectedImages).
Logic Flow:
Toggling Select Mode:
A function toggleSelectMode() toggles the gallery between Select and Normal modes.
Image Selection:
handleSelect() adds/removes image IDs from the selection array.
Deletion:
handleDelete() filters out the selected images and resets the selection.
Frontend UI/UX Requirements:
Grid Layout: Responsive 3-column image grid.
Checkbox Animation:
Checkboxes scale up when Select Mode activates (from 0 to full size).
Tapping checkboxes triggers a slight scaling effect for feedback.
Button Behavior:
The "Delete" button dims and disables if no images are selected.
It re-enables when selections exist.
