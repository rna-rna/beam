Design & Layout Brief
Overall Layout
Container:
The recents page should include a table-like “list view” that spans the available width. This view replaces (or is toggled from) the current grid/masonry view.

Column Headers:
At the top of the list view, include a header row with clearly defined column titles. The headers should have a subtle background and be separated from the data rows by a border.

Data Rows:
Each recent gallery is represented by one row. The rows should have hover states (e.g. a light background color change or subtle shadow) to indicate they are clickable and interactive.

Columns & Their Content
Include the following columns:

Thumbnail:

Appearance: A small image preview (e.g. 80×80 or 100×100 pixels) that shows the gallery’s thumbnail.
Behavior: This column is optional if space is tight on smaller screens; you could hide or collapse it responsively.
Title:

Appearance: The gallery’s title, rendered in a clear, legible font.
Sorting: Clicking the header should sort the rows alphabetically (A–Z for ascending, Z–A for descending).
Images:

Content: Display the number of images in the gallery (e.g., “12 images”).
Sorting: Clicking this header should sort the rows numerically (low-to-high or high-to-low).
Last Viewed:

Content: Show a friendly, relative timestamp (e.g., “just now”, “1 min ago”, “3 days ago”).
Details:
For galleries that have been viewed, this value comes from the gallery’s viewed_at timestamp.
For galleries you were invited to but haven’t viewed yet, use the invitation’s timestamp.
Sorting: The header should allow sorting chronologically (newest to oldest and vice versa).
Status:

Content:
Display a label (or “pill”) that indicates whether the gallery is “Owned by you” or “Shared with you”.
For galleries that were added via an invitation (and have not yet been viewed), include an extra “Invited” pill next to the status.
Sorting (Optional): You might allow sorting by status (e.g. grouping “Owned” versus “Invited/Shared”), though this is less critical than the other columns.
Interactive Features
Sortable Columns:
Each column header should be clickable. On click, it should toggle the sort order for that column (ascending ↔ descending).

Visual Cues:
Display an arrow icon (up or down) next to the column header text to indicate the current sort direction.
A simple transition or change in icon color can help signal which column is currently active for sorting.
Filtering Options:
While the search input at the top can continue filtering by title, you may also consider adding drop-down filters for individual columns (if desired) for more granular control.

Responsive Design:
On smaller screens, the table should either become horizontally scrollable or hide less-critical columns (such as the Thumbnail) to maintain legibility.

Row Click Action:
Clicking anywhere on a row should navigate the user to the gallery’s detail view (using the gallery’s slug). Make sure the hover state and clickable behavior are consistent.
