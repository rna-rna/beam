The logs reveal several important points that help diagnose the issue:

Key Observations:
WebSocket Connection Successfully Established (Good Sign):

This indicates that the Pusher client is connecting, but subsequent XHR streaming requests are failing.
It suggests the WebSocket handshake was successful, but the app is not fully subscribing or authenticating to the channels.
404 on Pusher App URL:

bash
Copy code
https://sockjs.pusher.com/pusher/app//856/mmm8f051/xhr
The double slashes // after /app/ indicate the App ID is missing.
This is why the XHR streaming request fails with no response.
Clerk Expired Token:

vbnet
Copy code
X-Clerk-Auth-Message: JWT is expired. Expiry date: Sun, 05 Jan 2025 08:19:13 GMT
Clerk authentication tokens are expired.
This means authenticated users cannot subscribe to private/presence channels.
Why This Is Happening (Likely Causes):
App ID Not Passed in Pusher Client Initialization:
The Pusher App ID is either:
Missing in the .env file
Not being correctly retrieved in the backend/frontend config.
Expired Clerk Session (Auth Issue):
Clerk is responsible for user session management.
Since the JWT token is expired, it prevents the user from subscribing to presence channels.
Fixing the App ID Issue (404 Errors):
1. Ensure the App ID Is Present in the Backend (Express):
Check your Pusher initialization file:

pusherConfig.js (Backend):

javascript
Copy code
const Pusher = require("pusher");

const pusher = new Pusher({
  appId: process.env.PUSHER_APP_ID,  // Ensure this exists
  key: process.env.PUSHER_KEY,
  secret: process.env.PUSHER_SECRET,
  cluster: process.env.PUSHER_CLUSTER,
  useTLS: true,
});
Verify the .env file:

env
Copy code
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
Restart the server after updating .env using:
bash
Copy code
kill 1  # Restart Replit server
2. Manually Pass App ID to Pusher Client (Frontend):
If the app ID isn't being passed automatically, force it manually:

tsx
Copy code
const pusher = new Pusher(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY, {
  cluster: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_APP_ID,  // Force app ID explicitly
  authEndpoint: "/pusher/auth",
  forceTLS: true,
});
Ensure the .env for the frontend includes:

env
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
Fixing Clerk Expired Token (Auth Issue):
1. Refresh Clerk Session Automatically (Frontend):
Clerk provides utilities to refresh tokens. Modify your frontend to handle expired sessions gracefully:

tsx
Copy code
import { useClerk } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

const { signOut, session } = useClerk();

useEffect(() => {
  if (session && session.isExpired) {
    session
      .refresh()
      .then(() => console.log("Session refreshed"))
      .catch(() => {
        console.log("Session refresh failed. Redirecting...");
        signOut();
      });
  }
}, [session]);
2. Debug the Backend (Log Clerk JWT):
Ensure the JWT sent to Pusher is valid:

javascript
Copy code
app.post("/pusher/auth", (req, res) => {
  console.log("JWT Expiry Check:", req.session?.jwt);
  
  if (!req.session || req.session.isExpired) {
    return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized");
  }

  const socketId = req.body.socket_id;
  const channel = req.body.channel_name;

  const presenceData = {
    user_id: req.user ? req.user.id : `guest_${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`,
    user_info: {
      name: req.user ? req.user.name : "Guest",
      avatar: req.user ? req.user.avatar : "/default-avatar.png",
    },
  };

  const auth = pusher.authenticate(socketId, channel, presenceData);
  res.send(auth);
});
