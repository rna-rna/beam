Issue:
The ghost image (drag preview) scales inconsistently during drag, appearing too large and resizing depending on the drag location.
This occurs due to dynamic scaling tied to viewport width (vw) and height (vh).
Root Cause:
The width and height of the ghost image are set using absolute values (100px) and vw units (maxWidth: 10vw).
This causes the ghost image to scale based on viewport size, resulting in unpredictable size adjustments.
Solution:
Fix Width and Height to maintain consistency across all drag positions.
Use rem or px for consistent sizing instead of viewport-based units (vw or vh).
Ensure that the drag image size is proportional but not larger than the original image.
Implementation (Adjust Ghost Image Size in Gallery.tsx):
Locate the ghost image rendering logic (around line 1155):

tsx
Copy code
{dragPosition && draggedItemIndex !== null && gallery?.images && (
  <motion.div
    className="fixed pointer-events-none z-50 ghost-image"
    style={{
      top: dragPosition.y,
      left: dragPosition.x,
      transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)",
      width: '80px',  // Reduced fixed width
      height: '80px',  // Reduced fixed height
      maxWidth: 'unset',  // Remove viewport scaling
      maxHeight: 'unset',
    }}
    initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
    animate={{ 
      opacity: 0.9, 
      scale: 1,
      transition: {
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 300,
        damping: 25
      }
    }}
    exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
  >
    <img
      src={gallery.images[draggedItemIndex].url}
      alt="Dragged Preview"
      className="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    />
  </motion.div>
)}
Changes Made:
Width/Height Reduced:
Changed from 100px to 80px to make the drag preview less intrusive.
Removed Viewport Scaling:
Deleted maxWidth: 10vw and maxHeight: 10vw to prevent inconsistent scaling.
Fixed Size Across Dragging:
The ghost image will maintain a fixed size regardless of drag position or screen size.
Why This Fix Works:
The ghost image now remains consistently sized during drag.
By removing viewport-based scaling, the ghost preview no longer adjusts dynamically with screen size or cursor position.
