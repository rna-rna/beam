Here’s a straightforward way to make each notification item clickable so that it navigates to the appropriate place (gallery, image, etc.):

Always store the necessary slug and IDs in your notification data (you’ve already fixed that for invites with gallerySlug; do similarly for stars, comments, replies, etc.). For example:

Stars: store gallerySlug, imageId.
Comments: store gallerySlug, imageId (and maybe commentId if you want to link directly to the comment).
Invites: store gallerySlug.
Uploads: store gallerySlug.
Use onSelect on the entire DropdownMenuItem. Radix UI (and shadcn/ui) typically fire onSelect rather than onClick. Then you can decide the route based on notif.type and notif.data.

Build the final link and redirect inside that handler. For example:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<DropdownMenuItem
  key={notif.id}
  // Use onSelect, not onClick
  onSelect={() => {
    const { type, data } = notif;

    // Suppose you store data.gallerySlug, data.imageId, data.commentId, etc.
    if ((type === 'comment' || type === 'comment-added') && data?.imageId) {
      // Go to a specific image + comment anchor
      window.location.href = `/g/${data.gallerySlug}?imageId=${data.imageId}#comment-${data.commentId}`;
    } else if ((type === 'star' || type === 'image-starred') && data?.imageId) {
      // Just go to that image
      window.location.href = `/g/${data.gallerySlug}?imageId=${data.imageId}`;
    } else if (type === 'invite' || type === 'gallery-invite') {
      // Link to the gallery
      window.location.href = `/g/${data.gallerySlug}`;
    } else {
      // Fallback or other notification types
      window.location.href = `/g/${data.gallerySlug || ''}`;
    }
  }}
  className={...}
>
  {/* The rest of your item content */}
</DropdownMenuItem>
Steps to Make It Work
Ensure your notifications always contain the fields you need:

For stars or comments, include both gallerySlug and imageId.
For an actual comment-reply, also include commentId if you want to jump to that.
Example server-side code for a comment notification:

ts
Copy
Edit
await db.insert(notifications).values({
  userId: editorUserId,
  type: 'comment',
  data: {
    actorName: userName,
    gallerySlug: image.gallery.slug, // so the front end can link
    imageId: image.id,               // so we can jump to the right image
    commentId: newlyCreatedComment.id
    // etc...
  },
  ...
});
In the front end, decide how to navigate. If you already have React Router or Next.js, you could use router.push(...) instead of window.location.href. The key is that onSelect actually fires when a user clicks the menu item.

Remove any other conditional <a> you might have. Just rely on a single unified “click item → go to route.”

With that, each notification item is clickable, and the user is taken to the relevant place in your app.
