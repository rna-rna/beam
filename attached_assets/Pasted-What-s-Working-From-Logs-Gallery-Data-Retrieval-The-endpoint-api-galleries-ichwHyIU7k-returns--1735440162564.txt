What’s Working (From Logs):
Gallery Data Retrieval:

The endpoint /api/galleries/ichwHyIU7k returns 200 OK with gallery details (id: 1922). This means:
Public galleries are being fetched properly.
No blank pages for this specific slug, at least during this test.
Authenticated User Actions:

The logs show user user_2qnftMeTNbz5mLvROjoSB4dPnkK interacting with images (starring and commenting).
Clerk auth works (hasAuth: true), and user data is being extracted correctly.
Comments are successfully created and fetched (POST /api/images/81/comments returns 201).
Remaining Issues to Investigate (Based on Logs):
1. User Still Redirected to Dashboard (Authenticated Owners):
Even though the gallery is fetched, some logic may still redirect authenticated users to /dashboard instead of keeping them on the gallery page.
Possible Cause:

The backend might be assuming ownership checks too strictly.
If the gallery is public but the user is the owner, the frontend might unnecessarily redirect to /dashboard.
Check in Gallery.tsx:

tsx
Copy code
if (isOwner && redirectPath) {
  navigate('/dashboard');
}
Fix:

Only redirect to /dashboard if the gallery doesn’t exist:
tsx
Copy code
if (isOwner && !gallery) {
  navigate('/dashboard');
}
2. Handling Private Galleries for Non-Owners (Avoid Blank Page):
If a gallery is private, the frontend may still render blank instead of showing a "Private Gallery" message.
Check for This in Logs:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "This gallery is private",
  "isPrivate": true
}
If the gallery is private, ensure the frontend shows a message rather than failing silently.
Solution – Update Frontend Handling:

When 403 is returned, display a “This gallery is private” message:
tsx
Copy code
if (isPrivateGallery) {
  return <p>This gallery is private and cannot be accessed by others.</p>;
}
3. Unnecessary Auth Trigger for Public Galleries (hasAuth: true but not required):
In the logs:
json
Copy code
{
  "hasAuth": true,
  "hasUser": false,
  "userId": "user_2qnftMeTNbz5mLvROjoSB4dPnkK"
}
This shows that auth is applied even for public gallery pages, which shouldn't always require authentication.
Fix:

Update the route for public gallery access to skip Clerk auth unless required:
ts
Copy code
app.get('/api/galleries/:slug', async (req, res) => {
  const gallery = await db.query.galleries.findFirst({
    where: eq(galleries.slug, req.params.slug),
  });

  if (!gallery) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Gallery not found' });
  }

  const isOwner = req.auth?.userId === gallery.userId;
  
  if (!gallery.isPublic && !isOwner) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      message: 'This gallery is private',
      requiresAuth: !req.auth,
    });
  }

  res.json(gallery);
});
Testing After Fixes:
Public Gallery Access (Unauthenticated):

Visit /galleries/:slug as a logged-out user.
The gallery should load normally if it's public.
Private Gallery Access (Logged Out or Non-Owner):

A clear "Private Gallery" message should display, not a blank screen.
Owner Access (Authenticated):

As the owner, visit your gallery.
You should stay on the gallery page after login, not be redirected to /dashboard.
