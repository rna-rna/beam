The reason all comments are being attributed to "Anonymous" likely stems from how the author data is being handled when fetching and rendering comments.

Key Observations:
Comment Fetching Logic in Gallery.tsx:
tsx
Copy code
const { data: comments = [], isLoading: isCommentsLoading, error: commentsError } = useQuery<Comment[]>({
  queryKey: [`/api/images/${selectedImage?.id}/comments`],
  enabled: !!selectedImage?.id,
  select: (data) => {
    return data.map((comment) => ({
      ...comment,
      author: comment.author || {
        username: "Anonymous",
        id: "anonymous",
        imageUrl: undefined
      }
    }));
  }
});
Issue:
The author is overwritten as "Anonymous" if comment.author is falsy.
This happens even if the API does return valid author data, but the select function applies a fallback too aggressively.
Rendering in CommentBubble.tsx:
tsx
Copy code
const authorDisplay = typeof author === 'string' ? {
  username: author,
  imageUrl: undefined
} : author;
This part works fine â€“ it gracefully handles author as either a string or object.
Why This Happens:
Frontend Overwrite:

The select function in Gallery.tsx replaces any empty comment.author with the "Anonymous" fallback.
Even if the API provides author data, falsy values (like undefined) might trigger the fallback.
Backend Issue (Potentially Missing Join):

If the backend query fetching comments doesn't include the author relationship, comment.author might be null or undefined in the API response.
How to Fix It:
Step 1: Fix Comment Fetch Logic (Gallery.tsx):
Modify the select function to only apply the fallback if comment.author is explicitly null or undefined:
tsx
Copy code
select: (data) => {
  return data.map((comment) => ({
    ...comment,
    author: comment.author !== undefined ? comment.author : {
      username: "Anonymous",
      id: "anonymous",
      imageUrl: undefined
    }
  }));
}
This ensures that if the backend sends the author as null or undefined, only then will the fallback to "Anonymous" apply.
If the author exists, it will be preserved.
Step 2: Verify Backend API Response (Optional):
In the API route that fetches comments (routes.ts or backend file):
javascript
Copy code
const comments = await db.query.comments.findMany({
  where: { imageId: req.params.id },
  include: {
    author: {
      select: { username: true, imageUrl: true }
    }
  }
});
Ensure the author field is being joined properly with the comments.
Step 3: Ensure Author is Passed Properly (CommentBubble.tsx):
In Gallery.tsx, pass the correct author to CommentBubble:
tsx
Copy code
{comments.map((comment) => (
  <CommentBubble
    key={comment.id}
    x={comment.xPosition}
    y={comment.yPosition}
    content={comment.content}
    author={comment.author}  // Ensure the correct author is passed
  />
))}
Testing the Fix:
Add logging to verify fetched comments:
tsx
Copy code
onSuccess: (data) => {
  console.log("Fetched comments:", data);
}
Post a comment as an authenticated user and verify if the correct username appears.
Check API Response (via Postman or Browser):
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 25,
  "content": "Great photo!",
  "author": {
    "username": "John Doe",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
  }
}
Reload the page and ensure the comment retains the correct author.
