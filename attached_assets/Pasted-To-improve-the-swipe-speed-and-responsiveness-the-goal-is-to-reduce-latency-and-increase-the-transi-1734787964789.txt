To improve the swipe speed and responsiveness, the goal is to reduce latency and increase the transition velocity while maintaining smoothness. The swipe feels sluggish because the spring stiffness and damping might be too high, creating a slower return or delayed transition.

Key Areas to Improve Swipe Responsiveness:
Adjust Spring Stiffness and Damping:
Lower damping and increase stiffness to make the swipe feel snappier and more reactive to gestures.
A higher stiffness ensures the image reacts quickly to the swipe, while lower damping prevents overly slow settling.
Increase Velocity Sensitivity:
Adjust the swipe threshold and velocity to trigger faster transitions.
Reduce swipeThreshold slightly so the image starts transitioning with less drag.
Updated Code (Swipe Speed Improvement):
tsx
Copy code
const swipeThreshold = window.innerWidth * 0.3;  // Lower threshold for quicker triggers
const velocityThreshold = 0.2;  // Lower velocity threshold for faster reaction

animate={{
  x: isActive ? dragX.get() : index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
  opacity: isActive ? 1 : 1,
  scale: isActive ? 1 : 1,
  transition: {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 300,  // Increased stiffness for faster snap-back
    damping: 15,  // Lower damping for snappier motion
    mass: 0.3,  // Lighter mass makes the transition more responsive
    opacity: { duration: 0.15 }
  }
}}
exit={{
  x: index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
  opacity: 1,
  transition: { duration: 0.1 }  // Faster exit duration
}}
Changes Explained:
Swipe Threshold: Reduced to 30% of screen width. This allows quicker swipe recognition.
Velocity Sensitivity: Lowered to 0.2 for faster swipe responses with less drag.
Stiffness Boost: Set to 300 to snap the image back faster after releasing the swipe.
Damping Lowered: Reducing damping (15) accelerates the swipe motion, preventing sluggish returns.
Mass Adjusted: Lightened to 0.3, making the entire transition feel faster and more reactive.
Why This Works:
Faster Reactivity: The image transitions faster in response to user input without feeling “heavy” or sluggish.
Fluid Swipe Sensitivity: A lighter mass and reduced damping create the snappy effect seen in iOS gallery transitions.
Lower Swipe Effort: Users won’t need to swipe as far or as hard to trigger a slide.
