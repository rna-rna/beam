 Integrate Into Your “Invite” Route
You already have something like:

ts
Copy
protectedRouter.post('/galleries/:slug/invite', async (req, res) => {
  const { role } = req.body;
  const email = req.body.email.toLowerCase();
  const { slug } = req.params;
  const userId = req.auth.userId;
  
  // You look up the gallery, do ownership checks, etc.
  // Then you look up Clerk to see if there's a matching user, etc.
  
  // e.g.:
  const usersResponse = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({
    email_address_query: email
  });
  const matchingUser = usersResponse.data?.find(...);
  const isRegistered = Boolean(matchingUser);

  // Then you do the DB logic to add invites, etc.
  // Now the new part: We send an email:

  try {
    const galleryTitle = gallery.title;
    
    // The link to *view* the gallery. Could be a front-end route?
    const inviteUrl = `https://your-frontend-url.com/g/${gallery.slug}`;

    // A link for sign-up, or maybe your main sign-up route:
    const signUpUrl = `https://your-frontend-url.com/sign-up?email=${email}`;

    await sendInviteEmail({
      toEmail: email,
      galleryTitle,
      inviteUrl,
      signUpUrl,
      isRegistered,
      role,
      // optional fromEmail: "no-reply@yourdomain.com"
    });

    return res.json({ message: 'Invite sent successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send invite email:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({
      message: 'Failed to invite user (email error)',
      details: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown'
    });
  }
});
Explanation:

We figure out isRegistered by checking if we found a matching user in Clerk.
We construct a inviteUrl that goes directly to your gallery page.
We construct a signUpUrl that goes to your sign-up flow.
We pass everything to sendInviteEmail.
Note that your logic for roles might differ:

If they’re invited as “Editor” or “Comment,” we mention they’ll probably have to create an account.
If it’s “View,” you can let them see it with minimal friction, but still encourage sign up.
