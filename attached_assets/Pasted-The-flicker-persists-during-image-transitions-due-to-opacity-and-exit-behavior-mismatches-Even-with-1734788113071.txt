The flicker persists during image transitions due to opacity and exit behavior mismatches. Even with opacity: 0.8 and blurred exit, the flicker happens because the outgoing image fades slightly before the new image fully covers it.

Why the Flicker Occurs:
Exit Opacity Drop – Even though the exiting image retains high opacity (0.8), it still dims before fully sliding out, exposing the black background for a brief moment.
Timing Overlap – The new image’s entry (x: dragX.get()) does not fully coincide with the exit of the previous image, leaving a tiny visual gap.
AnimatePresence Behavior – popLayout helps, but it doesn't eliminate the timing issue entirely.
Solution:
Keep Exiting Image at Full Opacity – Maintain opacity: 1 on exit to prevent any dimming.
Slight Delay on Exiting Image's Removal – Allow the exiting image to linger just outside the viewport (x: 105%) for a seamless overlap, instead of fading.
Remove Blur on Exit – Blurring can contribute to the flicker by causing visible artifacts during the fade.
Force Overlap with Z-Index – Ensure the incoming image immediately overlaps the outgoing one, keeping zIndex: 15 on active images.
Fix – Updated Exit and Animate Behavior:
tsx
Copy code
exit={{
  x: index > currentIndex ? '105%' : '-105%',  // Push image offscreen fully without fading
  opacity: 1,  // Keep full opacity to prevent flicker
  scale: 1,
  filter: 'blur(0px)',  // Remove blur to eliminate artifacts
  transition: { duration: 0.12 }
}}
animate={{
  x: isActive ? dragX.get() : index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
  opacity: isActive ? 1 : 1,  // No opacity change for non-active images
  scale: isActive ? 1 : 1,
  transition: {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 300,
    damping: 15,
    opacity: { duration: 0.15 }
  }
}}
Key Changes:
Exit at Full Opacity – Prevents any flicker by ensuring the outgoing image doesn’t fade before it slides out.
Slide Fully Out of View – Rather than fading at 100%, let the exiting image move slightly beyond (105%) to maintain overlap.
No Blur on Exit – Keeps the image sharp and clear during transitions, preventing visual artifacts.
Why This Works:
Continuous Image Presence – The exiting image remains fully visible until it is completely out of the viewport.
Smooth Layering – Active images seamlessly slide over previous ones without black gaps.
Faster Transitions – duration: 0.12 ensures the exit is fast enough to keep the experience snappy but smooth.
