Fixing Opacity Drop and Swipe Sensitivity Issues
Upon reviewing the code, the opacity drop during zoom and overly sensitive snap-to-next behavior while zoomed are caused by:

Opacity Drop During Zoom:
The imageOpacity transform is mapped to the scaleValue, but both start at 1. This subtly reduces opacity when zooming in (scaleValue > 1).
This creates the unintended effect of the image fading slightly during zoom.
Over-Sensitive Swipe to Next Image (While Zoomed):
In the handlePan function, the overflowX threshold (40px) is too low, allowing unintentional image transitions during pan.
When zoomed in, even minor horizontal panning can trigger the next image, leading to buggy transitions.
Fix 1 – Prevent Opacity Drop During Zoom:
Modify the opacity mapping to remain constant at 1 regardless of zoom level. This ensures the image stays fully opaque even when scaled.
Change this:

tsx
Copy code
const imageOpacity = useTransform(scaleValue, [1, 3], [1, 1]);
To this:

tsx
Copy code
const imageOpacity = useTransform(scaleValue, [1, 3], [1, 1], { clamp: true });
Why This Works:

By setting the opacity at 1 for the entire zoom range (scaleValue from 1 to 3), the image remains fully opaque during zoom.
Fix 2 – Add Tension to Swipe-to-Next (While Zoomed):
Increase the threshold (overflowX) needed to trigger the next image, reducing accidental image transitions when zoomed in.
Change this (in handlePan):

tsx
Copy code
if (overflowX > 40) {  // Trigger at 40px of overflow
To this:

tsx
Copy code
if (overflowX > 100) {  // Require 100px overflow for snap
Why This Works:

Raising the threshold from 40px to 100px means the user needs to pan further before the next image triggers, preventing accidental snaps.
Additional Improvements:
Inertia for Panning While Zoomed:
Add momentum (dragMomentum) to allow smoother panning while zoomed, preventing abrupt stops.
tsx
Copy code
dragMomentum={true}
Bounce Back When Over-Panning:
Apply bounce-back effects when reaching pan limits to enhance the natural feel.
tsx
Copy code
offsetX.set(clampPan(newX, maxX), {
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 250,
  damping: 20,
});
Updated Code (with Fixes):
tsx
Copy code
const handlePan = (event: any, info: PanInfo) => {
  const scale = scaleValue.get();
  const maxX = (window.innerWidth / 2) * (scale - 1);
  const maxY = (window.innerHeight / 2) * (scale - 1);

  const newX = offsetX.get() + info.delta.x;
  const newY = offsetY.get() + info.delta.y;
  const overflowX = Math.abs(newX) - maxX;

  if (overflowX > 100) {  // Increase threshold for snapping to next image
    offsetX.set(newX * 1.2);
    setTimeout(() => {
      const nextIndex = currentIndex + (newX < 0 ? 1 : -1);
      const clampedIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(nextIndex, images.length - 1));
      setCurrentIndex(clampedIndex);

      // Reset zoom and position when transitioning
      scaleValue.set(1);
      offsetX.set(0);
      offsetY.set(0);
    }, 100);
  } else {
    offsetX.set(clampPan(newX, maxX), {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 250,
      damping: 20,
    });
    offsetY.set(clampPan(newY, maxY), {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 250,
      damping: 20,
    });
  }
};
