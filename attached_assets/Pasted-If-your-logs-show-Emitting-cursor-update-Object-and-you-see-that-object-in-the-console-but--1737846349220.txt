If your logs show Emitting cursor-update: Object { ... }—and you see that object in the console—but nothing updates in your front-end UI, it typically means the server is indeed sending that cursor-update event, but your client code is either:

Not listening for "cursor-update", or
Listening for "cursor-update" but not using that data to update the DOM/UI.
1. Verify You Have a Matching Client-Side Listener
On the client, you must have:

js
Copy
Edit
socket.on("cursor-update", (data) => {
  console.log("Received cursor-update:", data);
  // ... update your UI with the x/y, color, etc.
});
If you never see “Received cursor-update: …” in the browser console, then either:

The event name is spelled/cased differently between your server and client.
You’re not actually connecting to the same namespace.
The server emits to some room or excludes the sender.
Check for any mismatch
If the server calls socket.emit("cursor-update", data), your client must use socket.on("cursor-update", ...).
If you’re broadcasting to everyone except the sender with socket.broadcast.emit("cursor-update", data), then the emitter won’t see it come back unless you also do a direct socket.emit(...).
2. Make Sure the Front-End Actually Uses the Data
Even if you do see something like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Received cursor-update: { x: 1067, y: 152, name: "Jack" ... }
you won’t see anything on screen unless you modify the DOM or your app’s state. For example, if you’re tracking positions in React:

js
Copy
Edit
socket.on("cursor-update", (data) => {
  setCursorPositions((positions) => ({
    ...positions,
    [data.id]: { x: data.x, y: data.y, color: data.color, name: data.name }
  }));
});
Then you’d render those cursor positions in some component. If you don’t do this step, you’ll see logs but no visible change on the page.

3. Double-Check You’re Using the Same Namespace (If Any)
If your server code is something like:

js
Copy
Edit
const galleryNs = io.of("/gallery");
galleryNs.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("cursor-update", (data) => {
    console.log("Emitting cursor-update", data);
    galleryNs.emit("cursor-update", data);
  });
});
Then on the client:

js
Copy
Edit
// must connect to "/gallery" namespace
const socket = io("/gallery");

socket.on("cursor-update", (payload) => {
  // ...
});
If your client is just io() (the default namespace), it will never see events from "/gallery".

4. Confirm the Client Code Actually Runs
Open DevTools → Console and watch for any errors. A JS error might prevent your code from executing the socket.on("cursor-update", ...).
Add logs around your code:
js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Registering cursor-update listener...");
socket.on("cursor-update", (data) => {
  console.log("Got cursor-update event!", data);
  // ...
});
console.log("Listener registration done.");
If you don’t see those logs, your code block might not be loading or is behind a syntax error.
