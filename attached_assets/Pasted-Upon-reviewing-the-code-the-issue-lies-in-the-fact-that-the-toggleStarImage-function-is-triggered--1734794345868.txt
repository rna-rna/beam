Upon reviewing the code, the issue lies in the fact that the toggleStarImage function is triggered, but the image's state (images[currentIndex].starred) does not update immediately after the mutation.

Why This Happens:
toggleStarImage triggers starMutation.mutate(), but this doesn't directly reflect on the images state until the query (/api/galleries) is invalidated and refetched.
The UI doesn't optimistically update the starred state until the backend responds, causing a delay or no visible feedback at all if the query fails.
Solution: Implement Optimistic Updates
To ensure immediate feedback, implement an optimistic update that toggles the starred state immediately when the button is pressed. If the mutation fails, revert the change.

Code Update (Optimistic Star Toggle):
tsx
Copy code
// Optimistic update for star toggle
const toggleStarImage = () => {
  const isCurrentlyStarred = images[currentIndex].starred;

  // Optimistically update UI
  const updatedImages = [...images];
  updatedImages[currentIndex].starred = !isCurrentlyStarred;
  setCurrentIndex(currentIndex);  // Force re-render with updated state

  // Perform the mutation
  starMutation.mutate(undefined, {
    onError: () => {
      // Revert on error
      updatedImages[currentIndex].starred = isCurrentlyStarred;
      setCurrentIndex(currentIndex);
    }
  });
};
How This Works:
Immediate Feedback: The star's visual state is updated immediately when tapped (optimistic update).
Revert on Failure: If the API call fails, the previous state is restored to avoid inconsistent UI.
Smooth Interaction: The user perceives instant responsiveness, while the backend processes the update in the background.
Refinement â€“ Subtle Animation for the Star Button:
Add a subtle scale animation when the star is tapped to make the interaction feel more polished and iOS-like:

tsx
Copy code
<motion.button
  onClick={toggleStarImage}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.85 }}
  animate={{ scale: 1 }}
  transition={{
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 400,
    damping: 20,
  }}
  className={`transition-colors ${
    images[currentIndex].starred
      ? 'text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300'
      : 'text-white/90 hover:text-white'
  }`}
>
  <Star
    className="w-6 h-6"
    fill={images[currentIndex].starred ? "currentColor" : "none"}
  />
</motion.button>
Testing Focus:
Tapping the Star:
Tap the star and ensure it immediately updates.
If the request fails, verify the star reverts to its previous state.
API Feedback (Success/Fail):
Test with both successful and failed API responses to ensure optimistic updates don't break the UI.
Swipe and Zoom:
Confirm that the star tap does not interfere with zooming/panning/swiping.
Optional Enhancements:
Add Haptic Feedback (Mobile Only):
tsx
Copy code
if ('vibrate' in navigator) {
  navigator.vibrate(30);  // Subtle haptic feedback
}
