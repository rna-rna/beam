The black screen issue during swiping likely stems from how Framer Motion is handling opacity transitions and image rendering. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening and how to fix it:

Why the Black Screen Occurs:
Opacity Animation Issue:

Non-active images (opacity: 0) are still in the DOM but fully transparent. This causes the screen to appear black during transitions.
When swiping quickly, the animation may lag behind, causing the current image to disappear before the next one fully animates.
Exit Animation Conflict:

The exit={{ opacity: 0 }} combined with mode="wait" means that the exiting image completely disappears before the next image animates in.
This creates a flicker or black gap during the transition.
Only One Image in View (Mode="wait"):

Since AnimatePresence with mode="wait" forces the current image to exit fully before the next enters, it causes a brief blackout.
How to Fix It:
Adjust Exit Animation to Prevent Blackout:
Instead of instantly dropping opacity to 0, keep the exiting image slightly visible during the transition.
javascript
Copy code
exit={{
  opacity: 0.2,  // Don't fully hide; maintain a slight fade-out
  transition: { duration: 0.1 }  
}}
Render Overlapping Images During Swipe:
Allow the next image to animate in before the current one fully exits by modifying mode and overlap behavior:
javascript
Copy code
<AnimatePresence initial={false} mode="popLayout">
This lets the next image pop in and overlap the previous one briefly, creating a smoother handoff.
Ensure Active Image Always Has Priority:
Use zIndex to guarantee that the active image is on top, preventing black screens even during opacity transitions.
javascript
Copy code
const zIndex = isActive ? 10 : 5;  // Slight overlap instead of disappearing
Updated Key Code (Fix Black Screen on Swipe):
tsx
Copy code
<AnimatePresence initial={false} mode="popLayout">
  {images.map((image, index) => {
    if (Math.abs(index - currentIndex) > 1) return null;

    const isActive = index === currentIndex;
    const zIndex = isActive ? 10 : 5;

    return (
      <motion.div
        key={image.id}
        className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center"
        style={{
          zIndex,
          scrollSnapAlign: 'start',
          scrollSnapStop: 'always',
          x: isActive ? dragX : undefined,
          pointerEvents: isActive ? 'auto' : 'none',
        }}
        initial={{
          x: index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
          opacity: 1,  // Keep visible during initial entry
        }}
        animate={{
          x: isActive ? dragX.get() : index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
          opacity: isActive ? 1 : 0.5,  // Slight fade instead of disappearing
          transition: {
            type: "spring",
            stiffness: 150,
            damping: 20,
            opacity: { duration: 0.2 }
          }
        }}
        exit={{
          x: index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
          opacity: 0.2,  // Avoid full black screen by keeping slight visibility
          transition: { duration: 0.1 }
        }}
      >
        <div className="relative w-full h-full px-4">
          <motion.img
            src={image.url}
            alt=""
            className="w-full h-full object-contain select-none"
            draggable={false}
            initial={false}
            animate={{
              scale: isActive ? 1 : 0.95,
            }}
            transition={{
              type: "spring",
              stiffness: 150,
              damping: 20
            }}
          />
        </div>
      </motion.div>
    );
  })}
</AnimatePresence>
Why This Works:
Partial Opacity: Prevents the black screen effect by allowing a small amount of the previous image to remain visible during transitions.
Layer Management: Ensures the active image consistently sits on top, avoiding visual gaps during swipes.
Smooth Overlap: By using popLayout instead of wait, the next image can overlap the current image slightly, replicating iOS-style gallery swipes.
Testing and Debugging Tips:
Test Swipe Speeds: Try swiping fast and slow to ensure the fix works under different swipe velocities.
Log Animation Steps: Temporarily add logs inside the animate and exit handlers to track opacity and x changes during swipes.
javascript
Copy code
console.log("Animating Image:", image.id, "Opacity:", opacity.get());
