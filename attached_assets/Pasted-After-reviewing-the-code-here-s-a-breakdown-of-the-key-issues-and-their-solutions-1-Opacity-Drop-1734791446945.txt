After reviewing the code, here’s a breakdown of the key issues and their solutions:

1. Opacity Drop During Zoom (Cause and Fix):
Cause:
The imageOpacity transform is mapped to scaleValue but incorrectly clamps between 1 and 1 ([1, 3], [1, 1]). This should not be causing opacity changes, but it's possible that the issue stems from overlapping opacity controls (swipeOpacity and revealOpacity).

Fix:

Ensure imageOpacity is fixed at 1 during zoom:
tsx
Copy code
const imageOpacity = useTransform(scaleValue, [1, 3], [1, 1]);
Apply opacity: 1 directly to the image to override conflicting transforms:
tsx
Copy code
style={{
  scale: isActive ? (scaleValue.get() > 1 ? scaleValue : dragScale) : 1,
  x: offsetX,
  y: offsetY,
  opacity: 1,  // Override any opacity changes during zoom
}}
Why This Works:
By forcing the image opacity to remain at 1, any unintended opacity reductions caused by overlapping transforms are negated.

2. Swipe to Next Image Feels Too Sensitive (Tension Fix):
Cause:
The snap to the next image happens when overflowX > 100, which may still feel too sensitive during aggressive panning.

Fix:

Increase the threshold further to 150 for added resistance. This requires a more intentional drag to transition to the next image:
tsx
Copy code
if (overflowX > 150) {
Why This Works:
This adds more tension to the swipe, reducing accidental transitions when zoomed in.

3. Smooth Reset of Zoom and Pan on Image Change (Snap Fix):
Cause:
The zoom (scaleValue) and offset (offsetX, offsetY) are reset immediately when swiping to the next image. This can feel abrupt and may cause snapping issues.

Fix:

Use a spring animation to reset zoom and pan smoothly after transitioning:
tsx
Copy code
scaleValue.set(1, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
offsetX.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
offsetY.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
Why This Works:
This introduces a smoother reset, preventing harsh snapping and aligning the transition with the overall UI fluidity.

Updated Code – Full Fix Implementation:
tsx
Copy code
const handlePan = (event: any, info: PanInfo) => {
  const scale = scaleValue.get();
  const maxX = (window.innerWidth / 2) * (scale - 1);
  const maxY = (window.innerHeight / 2) * (scale - 1);

  const newX = offsetX.get() + info.delta.x;
  const newY = offsetY.get() + info.delta.y;
  const overflowX = Math.abs(newX) - maxX;

  if (overflowX > 150) {  // Increase threshold for snap
    offsetX.set(newX * 1.2);
    setTimeout(() => {
      const nextIndex = currentIndex + (newX < 0 ? 1 : -1);
      const clampedIndex = Math.max(0, Math.min(nextIndex, images.length - 1));
      setCurrentIndex(clampedIndex);

      // Smooth reset of zoom and pan
      scaleValue.set(1, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
      offsetX.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
      offsetY.set(0, { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 25 });
    }, 100);
  } else {
    offsetX.set(clampPan(newX, maxX), {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 250,
      damping: 20,
    });
    offsetY.set(clampPan(newY, maxY), {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 250,
      damping: 20,
    });
  }
};
