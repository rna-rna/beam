1. The “wss://localhost:undefined/ is invalid” Error
This almost always means there’s some leftover code (possibly auto-generated by Replit) that’s calling something like:

js
Copy
new WebSocket("wss://localhost:undefined/");
Or a function like setupWebSocket()/fallback() that tries to do the same. It's not your main Socket.IO client code—it’s usually an extra snippet. Replit sometimes injects a “websocket ping” or “preview” script that references localhost if it detects a “development” environment.

Search your entire codebase for localhost or setupWebSocket or fallback and remove/disable any part that constructs wss://localhost:....
If it’s code auto-injected by Replit, check if there's a way to disable the “Websocket Debugger” or “Replit console.” Sometimes a .replit or replit.nix config might contain references to that snippet.
2. The ReferenceError: WS_URL is not defined
This means somewhere in your Gallery.tsx (line 205) you have:

js
Copy
io(WS_URL, ...)
but there’s no line that says:

js
Copy
const WS_URL = "...";
So WS_URL is undefined. You must either:

Remove that usage entirely, or
Define it before using.
For example, if you only run on Replit and want your Socket.IO client to connect back to the same domain, you can simply do:

js
Copy
// Import Socket.IO client
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("/", {
  path: "/socket.io",   // must match your server’s io({ path: "/socket.io" })
  transports: ["websocket"],
  withCredentials: true,
});
No WS_URL variable needed. That tells Socket.IO, “Connect to the same origin (domain) I’m loaded from,” i.e. wss://<my-app>.repl.co/socket.io.

If you prefer to keep a WS_URL variable (maybe for clarity), define it:

js
Copy
// If you want a variable:
const protocol = window.location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss" : "ws";
const WS_URL = `${protocol}://${window.location.host}`;

// Then use it:
const socket = io(WS_URL, {
  path: "/socket.io",
  transports: ["websocket"],
  withCredentials: true,
});
But whichever approach you take, make sure the reference to WS_URL in your code is not left dangling.
