The slight black blink during transitions is caused by how AnimatePresence and motion.div handle the exit and entry animations. The mode="wait" ensures clean transitions but can momentarily create gaps between images.

Why the Black Blink Happens:
Exit Timing Delay:
The exiting image fully disappears (opacity: 0) before the next image animates in, causing a brief black flicker.

No Overlap in Transition:
The exit={{ opacity: 0 }} causes the current image to vanish abruptly. Since the next image hasn't fully transitioned in, the screen goes black.

Lack of Continuous Image Presence:
Only one image is visible during the transition (mode="wait"), which can cause gaps between transitions.

Solution:
Immediate Overlapping Transitions: Allow both the exiting and entering images to overlap during transitions by using mode="popLayout" instead of wait.
Layered Transition Approach: Ensure the exiting image fades out slowly while the next one slides in immediately.
Key Fixes:
Switch to popLayout for Smoother Transitions:

tsx
Copy code
<AnimatePresence initial={false} mode="popLayout">
This prevents the black screen by allowing the next image to slide in before the previous one fully exits.
Staggered Opacity and Slide Animations:
Let the opacity linger slightly before fading out completely.

tsx
Copy code
exit={{
  x: index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
  opacity: 0.5,  // Gradual fade out instead of immediate 0
  transition: { duration: 0.15 }
}}
Keep Exiting Image Visible Longer:
Prevent full disappearance by reducing opacity gradually instead of instantly.

tsx
Copy code
animate={{
  opacity: isActive ? 1 : 0.7,  // Exiting image fades but never vanishes abruptly
}}
Updated Code (Seamless Transitions):
tsx
Copy code
<AnimatePresence initial={false} mode="popLayout">
  {images.map((image, index) => {
    if (Math.abs(index - currentIndex) > 1) return null;

    const isActive = index === currentIndex;
    const zIndex = isActive ? 10 : 5;

    return (
      <motion.div
        key={image.id}
        className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center"
        style={{
          zIndex,
          scrollSnapAlign: 'start',
          scrollSnapStop: 'always',
          pointerEvents: isActive ? 'auto' : 'none',
        }}
        initial={{
          x: index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
          opacity: 1,
        }}
        animate={{
          x: isActive ? dragX.get() : index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
          opacity: isActive ? 1 : 0.7,  // Ensure overlap during transitions
          transition: {
            type: "spring",
            stiffness: 150,
            damping: 20,
            opacity: { duration: 0.2 }
          }
        }}
        exit={{
          x: index > currentIndex ? '100%' : '-100%',
          opacity: 0.5,  // Linger at 0.5 opacity instead of instant vanish
          transition: { duration: 0.15 }
        }}
      >
        <div className="relative w-full h-full px-4">
          <motion.img
            src={image.url}
            alt=""
            className="w-full h-full object-contain select-none"
            draggable={false}
            initial={false}
            animate={{
              scale: isActive ? 1 : 0.95,
            }}
            transition={{
              type: "spring",
              stiffness: 150,
              damping: 20,
            }}
          />
        </div>
      </motion.div>
    );
  })}
</AnimatePresence>
Why This Works:
Overlapping Transitions: popLayout ensures the incoming image enters before the previous one exits.
Partial Opacity: Exiting images fade to 0.5 instead of disappearing immediately, preventing flicker.
No Black Blink: Since there is always at least one image partially visible, the screen never goes black.
