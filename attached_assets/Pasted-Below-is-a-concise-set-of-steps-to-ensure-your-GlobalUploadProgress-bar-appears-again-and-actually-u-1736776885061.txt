Below is a concise set of steps to ensure your GlobalUploadProgress bar appears again and actually updates. The key is:

You must render <GlobalUploadProgress /> somewhere in your top-level app (so it’s always in the DOM).
Make sure your upload logic (e.g. in gallery.tsx or uploaddropzone.tsx) actually calls the Add, Update, and Complete methods from the UploadContext.
1. Render the GlobalUploadProgress
In your top-level app.tsx (or wherever you wrap <UploadProvider>), do something like:

tsx
Copy code
import { UploadProvider } from "@/context/UploadContext";
import GlobalUploadProgress from "@/components/GlobalUploadProgress"; 
// or wherever globaluploadprogress is

function App() {
  return (
    <UploadProvider>
      <GlobalUploadProgress />
      {/* the rest of your app routes */}
    </UploadProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
This ensures that no matter what page you’re on, if batches.length > 0, the progress UI is shown. If you never see it, then either:

The code is not actually calling addBatch etc.
Or the progress stays at 0 and instantly completes.
2. Call Your addBatch, updateBatchProgress, and completeBatch
Inside your upload logic (like in uploaddropzone.tsx or gallery.tsx), you have to do the following:

addBatch — When you begin the upload.
updateBatchProgress — Each time you get a progress event.
completeBatch — When the upload finishes (whether success or error).
Below is an example that lines up with how your context expects these calls. If we look at your onDrop in uploaddropzone.tsx, you actually do:

js
Copy code
const uploadId = `${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
addBatch(uploadId, totalSize, acceptedFiles.length);
Then in the loop, for each file:

js
Copy code
xhr.upload.onprogress = (event) => {
  if (event.lengthComputable) {
    const incrementBytes = event.loaded - (previousProgress ?? 0);
    updateBatchProgress(uploadId, incrementBytes);
    previousProgress = event.loaded;
  }
};
Finally when the entire loop completes:

js
Copy code
completeBatch(uploadId, /* success = true/false */ true);
Make sure you’re actually doing these calls (your snippet does show them in onDrop). That means your batches array in UploadContext should fill up and progress should appear in <GlobalUploadProgress />.
