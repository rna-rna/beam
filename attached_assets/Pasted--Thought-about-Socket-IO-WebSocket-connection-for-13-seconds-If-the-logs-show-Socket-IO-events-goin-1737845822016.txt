Thought about Socket.IO WebSocket connection for 13 seconds
If the logs show Socket.IO events going through, but nothing appears in your UI, the most common reasons are:

No Matching “.on()” Handler in the Front End

You might be emitting "cursor-update" (etc.) on the server, but in your client code, you need:
js
Copy
Edit
socket.on("cursor-update", (data) => {
  console.log("Received cursor-update event", data);
  // update your UI accordingly
});
If you never call socket.on("cursor-update", ...), you’ll see nothing happen in the UI.
Typos or Mismatch in Event Names

Double-check that the event name you emit from the server exactly matches the one you listen for in the client. (e.g., "cursor-update" vs. "cursorupdate", or mismatch in letter case).
Sometimes one side uses "cursor_updated" or "CursorUpdate", or a small spelling difference. Socket.IO won’t warn you if you mismatch names.
Namespace or Connection Issues

If you’re using custom namespaces (e.g., io.of("/admin") on the server), you must connect to that same namespace in the client: const socket = io("/admin");
If you accidentally connect to the default namespace but send events in a custom namespace, the client never sees them.
Frontend Code Doesn’t Actually Use the Data

Even if you do socket.on("cursor-update", (data) => console.log(data)), you’ll only see logs in the console. If you want to display data in the DOM, you need to manually update the UI (e.g., setting some <div>.innerText or using a React/Vue state).
Make sure your event handler actually changes the page in some way.
Check for Client-Side Errors

If your frontend code has a JavaScript error earlier, the socket code may never run. Open DevTools → Console to see if there are any runtime errors preventing the code from executing.
Quick Debug Steps
Add console logs:
js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Attempting to connect...");
const socket = io(); // or your full URL

socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("Connected with ID:", socket.id);
});

socket.on("cursor-update", (data) => {
  console.log("Got cursor-update:", data);
  // do something with data
});
Watch the browser console for these logs. If you see “Connected with ID: …” but never see “Got cursor-update: …”, you know the event name or namespace is mismatched. If you don’t even see “Connected with ID…”, the client code might not be running or the connection is failing.
Once you have a matching socket.on("some-event") in the client that does something with the data, you’ll see the updates appear in your front-end.
