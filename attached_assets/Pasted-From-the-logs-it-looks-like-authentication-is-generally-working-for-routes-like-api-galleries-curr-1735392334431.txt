From the logs, it looks like authentication is generally working for routes like /api/galleries/current and /api/galleries/create since the server successfully identifies the user and creates a gallery. However, there are key things to unpack regarding the "Authentication failed" error you're facing with comment submission.

What's Happening in the Logs:
hasAuth: true but headers: 'missing' – This shows that while the authentication middleware expects a token (hasAuth: true), the Authorization header isn't present (headers: 'missing').

For successful routes (/api/galleries/create), headers: 'present' indicates that the token is being passed correctly.

Root Cause:
The issue is isolated to routes where the Authorization header is missing:

Authorization token isn't attached properly during fetch calls for comments.
This could be caused by:
getToken() failure – The token retrieval might intermittently fail.
Comment fetch call skips attaching the header – The code path that triggers comment submission may not correctly pass the token.
Protected route middleware – The backend might enforce stricter checks on certain routes (/api/images/:id/comments) than others.
Solution:
1. Ensure Token Retrieval is Robust:
In CommentBubble.tsx:

tsx
Copy code
const token = await getToken().catch(() => null);
console.log("Token:", token);

if (!token) {
  toast({
    title: "Authentication Error",
    description: "Please sign in again.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
Why: This will help confirm if getToken() is failing. If the log shows null, focus on Clerk setup.
2. Force Attach the Token to All Requests:
Modify the fetch call in CommentBubble.tsx to enforce the token:

tsx
Copy code
const response = await fetch(`/api/images/${imageId}/comments`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': token ? `Bearer ${token}` : ''
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    content,
    xPosition: x,
    yPosition: y,
    userId: user?.id
  })
});
Why: Even if token is empty, the request will still include an Authorization header (though invalid), making the error clearer if the backend expects it.
3. Backend: Relax Auth Requirement for Debugging
If the issue persists, temporarily modify the backend to bypass strict auth checks for comment submission (for debugging purposes):

ts
Copy code
const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];
if (!token) {
  console.warn("Missing auth token – allowing for debug");
  return next();  // Let the request pass temporarily
}
Why: This lets you determine if the issue is purely with the Authorization header.
4. Add Fallback to userId in Payload:
Even if the token fails, make sure the user ID is included in the request:

tsx
Copy code
body: JSON.stringify({
  content,
  xPosition: x,
  yPosition: y,
  userId: user?.id || "anonymous"
})
Why: This ensures the server can associate the comment even if token validation fails momentarily.
