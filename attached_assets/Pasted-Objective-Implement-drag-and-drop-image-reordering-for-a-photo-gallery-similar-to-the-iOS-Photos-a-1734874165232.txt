Objective:
Implement drag-and-drop image reordering for a photo gallery, similar to the iOS Photos app or Trello boards. This feature should work intuitively on both desktop (mouse-driven) and mobile (touch-driven) environments.

Feature Breakdown:
Select Mode for Reordering (Similar to iOS Photos):
Users can enter Select Mode by tapping a "Select" or "Reorder" button.
In Select Mode, users can drag images vertically or horizontally to reorder them within the masonry grid.
Dragged images dynamically shift around the grid during the reorder process.
On mobile, smooth touch gestures should make the experience feel natural and responsive.
Users exit Select Mode by tapping "Done" or "Cancel."
Desktop Drag-and-Drop:
Mouse-Driven Interaction: Users click and drag images to rearrange them.
Reordering on Drop: When the mouse is released, the images snap into place.
The layout dynamically adjusts as images are reordered in real-time.
Mobile Touch Gestures:
Touch-Driven Dragging: Users can tap and hold to engage drag-and-drop.
Long-Press to Drag: Holding down an image for 400ms should activate drag mode.
Live Feedback: Adjacent images shift dynamically as the user drags an image around.
Natural Physics: The grid should respond with subtle bounce/elastic effects to mimic native iOS movement.
One-Finger Drag: The user can drag with one finger, and the image should follow the finger.
Visual Feedback:
Opacity Drop: While dragging, the selected image should slightly lower in opacity (opacity-75).
Scaling Effect: The image scales slightly (scale-105) to emphasize it's in motion.
Drop Shadow: A light drop shadow can appear on drag for added depth.
Reordering API Call:
When the drag ends, the new order is sent to the backend to update the gallery:
json
Copy code
{
  "order": [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]
}
This ensures the new layout is saved and persists after refresh.
Technical Requirements:
Frontend:

Framer Motion for drag-and-drop animations (motion.div).
Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive grid adjustments.
React State Management (useState) for tracking reorder state.
Backend:

POST /reorder API to save the new image order.
Expect an array of image IDs in their new order.
Responsiveness:

Ensure the gallery scales dynamically on both desktop and mobile screens using responsive grid layouts (grid-cols).
The drag-and-drop feature must work seamlessly across devices without breaking the layout.
Instructions for Replit Implementation:
1. Desktop Drag-and-Drop (Mouse Driven):
Use Framer Motion to wrap each image in a motion.div with drag="y".
When the drag ends, calculate the new position and update the state.
On onDragEnd(), send the updated image order to the server.
Implement smooth layout shifts by using layout on the motion div.
Use grid or flexbox to ensure that images reflow naturally.
2. Mobile Drag-and-Drop (Touch Driven):
Implement long-press detection (400ms) using useState to trigger drag mode.
On long-press, enable drag using drag="y" or drag="x".
Images shift dynamically as the user drags the image around.
Use Framer Motion’s dragConstraints to keep images within the grid container.
Ensure the reordering logic is the same as desktop – update state and send API call on drag end.
3. UI/UX Enhancements:
On drag start, apply a scale-105 effect with a slight opacity drop.
Add spring animations for smooth bounce-back effects when the image is dropped.
Ensure drag-and-drop does not trigger accidental swipes or page scrolls.
Implement a "Done" button to exit Select Mode.
Example Code for Reference:
tsx
Copy code
<motion.div
  drag={selectMode ? "y" : false}
  dragConstraints={{ top: 0, bottom: 0 }}
  onDragEnd={(event, info) => handleDragEnd(event, index, info)}
  whileDrag={{ scale: 1.05, opacity: 0.85 }}
  layout
>
  <img
    src={image.url}
    alt=""
    className="rounded-md w-full object-cover"
  />
</motion.div>
